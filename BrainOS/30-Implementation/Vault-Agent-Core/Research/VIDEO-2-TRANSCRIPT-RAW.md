## Transcript (timestamped snippets)

- [00:00:00.080 -> 00:00:04.200] in today's video I'm going to go in
- [00:00:02.040 -> 00:00:06.600] depth on templating the zedcast and
- [00:00:04.200 -> 00:00:09.400] system that I've modified for code
- [00:00:06.600 -> 00:00:11.160] capture organized distill and Express in
- [00:00:09.400 -> 00:00:13.360] a way that it's much more practical for
- [00:00:11.160 -> 00:00:15.559] the digital ecosystem hello my name is
- [00:00:13.360 -> 00:00:17.560] Callum also known as Wonder loots and
- [00:00:15.559 -> 00:00:20.400] welcome to today's tutorial on
- [00:00:17.560 -> 00:00:22.800] templating zetel Casten walking through
- [00:00:20.400 -> 00:00:25.119] my molecular zetel Casten system in
- [00:00:22.800 -> 00:00:27.119] obsidian in today's information overload
- [00:00:25.119 -> 00:00:28.880] age it's incredibly easy to feel
- [00:00:27.119 -> 00:00:31.080] overwhelmed by the sheer volume of
- [00:00:28.880 -> 00:00:32.800] information we consume each day I use
- [00:00:31.080 -> 00:00:34.879] obsidian to help deal with information
- [00:00:32.800 -> 00:00:37.399] overload leveraging personal Knowledge
- [00:00:34.879 -> 00:00:39.680] Management Theory and my second brain to
- [00:00:37.399 -> 00:00:41.760] filter information in my creation and
- [00:00:39.680 -> 00:00:43.879] knowledge work obsidian allows me to
- [00:00:41.760 -> 00:00:46.160] both offload information into my second
- [00:00:43.879 -> 00:00:48.280] brain my digital mind and make
- [00:00:46.160 -> 00:00:50.320] connections between that information to
- [00:00:48.280 -> 00:00:52.480] form knowledge that boosts the value of
- [00:00:50.320 -> 00:00:54.399] my creativity and my knowledge work I
- [00:00:52.480 -> 00:00:57.160] refined my note ticking system over the
- [00:00:54.399 -> 00:01:00.519] last two years modifying zedcast and as
- [00:00:57.160 -> 00:01:02.840] I wrote over 50 articles over 15 50,000
- [00:01:00.519 -> 00:01:04.320] words or approximately three books worth
- [00:01:02.840 -> 00:01:06.720] this is the best way that I have ever
- [00:01:04.320 -> 00:01:08.799] found to structure information in a way
- [00:01:06.720 -> 00:01:10.520] that I can actually use the notes that
- [00:01:08.799 -> 00:01:12.080] I'm taking effectively what I'm doing
- [00:01:10.520 -> 00:01:14.600] here is I'm converting Atomic note
- [00:01:12.080 -> 00:01:16.280] taking into molecular note taking here's
- [00:01:14.600 -> 00:01:18.600] today's outline an overview of
- [00:01:16.280 -> 00:01:20.520] templating notes in my molecular zetoc
- [00:01:18.600 -> 00:01:22.320] Casten system capturing important
- [00:01:20.520 -> 00:01:24.920] information and ideas with fleeting
- [00:01:22.320 -> 00:01:27.320] notes organizing my system with topics
- [00:01:24.920 -> 00:01:29.680] tags and folders distilling the core
- [00:01:27.320 -> 00:01:31.360] value with atoms and molecules also
- [00:01:29.680 -> 00:01:33.479] known as as permanent notes and
- [00:01:31.360 -> 00:01:36.040] expressing new ideas in original work
- [00:01:33.479 -> 00:01:37.560] with allies formed as note sequences my
- [00:01:36.040 -> 00:01:39.520] system is inspired by one of the most
- [00:01:37.560 -> 00:01:41.439] prolific notet takers and writers of all
- [00:01:39.520 -> 00:01:44.159] time Nicholas Lumen who created the
- [00:01:41.439 -> 00:01:46.399] zedel Casten system he used this system
- [00:01:44.159 -> 00:01:48.799] to publish more than 70 books in 400
- [00:01:46.399 -> 00:01:50.680] articles approximately two books a year
- [00:01:48.799 -> 00:01:52.640] I modified his system to be a lot more
- [00:01:50.680 -> 00:01:55.119] practical for the Modern Age the digital
- [00:01:52.640 -> 00:01:56.600] world using tools like obsidian that can
- [00:01:55.119 -> 00:01:58.759] help augment the connections we're
- [00:01:56.600 -> 00:02:01.000] making inside of our digital minds or
- [00:01:58.759 -> 00:02:03.280] our second brains my not taking system
- [00:02:01.000 -> 00:02:05.119] is a hybrid between zetel Casten and the
- [00:02:03.280 -> 00:02:08.280] code method from building a second brain
- [00:02:05.119 -> 00:02:10.560] by TGO Forte capture organized distill
- [00:02:08.280 -> 00:02:12.680] Express I found that by modifying the
- [00:02:10.560 -> 00:02:14.879] physical system of the zle castom with
- [00:02:12.680 -> 00:02:16.519] the modern note ticking system of code I
- [00:02:14.879 -> 00:02:18.519] had the best of both worlds with a
- [00:02:16.519 -> 00:02:20.599] hybrid system that allowed me to truly
- [00:02:18.519 -> 00:02:22.640] augment my personal Knowledge Management
- [00:02:20.599 -> 00:02:24.480] and has helped me to publish so many
- [00:02:22.640 -> 00:02:25.959] articles and make hundreds of YouTube
- [00:02:24.480 -> 00:02:27.640] videos I think that this system will
- [00:02:25.959 -> 00:02:29.920] work for any Creator any knowledge
- [00:02:27.640 -> 00:02:31.879] worker anyone who's looking to work with
- [00:02:29.920 -> 00:02:33.840] information to reduce information
- [00:02:31.879 -> 00:02:35.440] overload and increase the value of the
- [00:02:33.840 -> 00:02:37.319] knowledge and creativity that they're
- [00:02:35.440 -> 00:02:39.200] generating the goal of this system is to
- [00:02:37.319 -> 00:02:41.400] shift away from just taking notes for
- [00:02:39.200 -> 00:02:43.920] the sake of taking notes just copying
- [00:02:41.400 -> 00:02:46.480] and instead take smart notes that are
- [00:02:43.920 -> 00:02:48.360] designed for purpose to connect with our
- [00:02:46.480 -> 00:02:50.360] existing knowledge base so that we can
- [00:02:48.360 -> 00:02:52.640] generate more value in the long run
- [00:02:50.360 -> 00:02:55.239] where we actually Forge knowledge and
- [00:02:52.640 -> 00:02:57.080] build on it so it compounds over time
- [00:02:55.239 -> 00:02:59.000] generating emergent patterns in our
- [00:02:57.080 -> 00:03:01.440] thinking my system is also inspired by
- [00:02:59.000 -> 00:03:04.239] Robert Martin at reasonabl deviations
- [00:03:01.440 -> 00:03:06.319] docomo cular note ticking system I
- [00:03:04.239 -> 00:03:08.120] modified that along with zle Casten to
- [00:03:06.319 -> 00:03:09.519] create a hybrid system that works best
- [00:03:08.120 -> 00:03:11.400] for me if you're interested in learning
- [00:03:09.519 -> 00:03:13.319] more about what settle Casten is and the
- [00:03:11.400 -> 00:03:15.200] goals of personal Knowledge Management I
- [00:03:13.319 -> 00:03:16.720] recommend checking out part one of this
- [00:03:15.200 -> 00:03:18.599] video after you've walked through the
- [00:03:16.720 -> 00:03:21.000] template system so you have a better
- [00:03:18.599 -> 00:03:22.480] idea and more context on how it all fits
- [00:03:21.000 -> 00:03:24.680] together this system can be kind of
- [00:03:22.480 -> 00:03:26.239] confusing and feel very abstract so I
- [00:03:24.680 -> 00:03:27.480] hope that by going through the theory
- [00:03:26.239 -> 00:03:29.519] after you've seen the Practical
- [00:03:27.480 -> 00:03:31.680] component you'll have a better idea on
- [00:03:29.519 -> 00:03:33.760] how you can actually use this system in
- [00:03:31.680 -> 00:03:36.879] real life this system took me hundreds
- [00:03:33.760 -> 00:03:38.680] of hours to build refine and recalibrate
- [00:03:36.879 -> 00:03:40.879] over time if you would like a copy of
- [00:03:38.680 -> 00:03:43.480] these templates along with the obsidian
- [00:03:40.879 -> 00:03:45.319] canvas workflow I'm making this template
- [00:03:43.480 -> 00:03:48.319] system available as a downloadable
- [00:03:45.319 -> 00:03:50.239] folder to members of my tier one on my
- [00:03:48.319 -> 00:03:51.640] YouTube membership if you're interested
- [00:03:50.239 -> 00:03:52.799] in joining this and want to support me
- [00:03:51.640 -> 00:03:54.480] for all the work that I put into
- [00:03:52.799 -> 00:03:56.239] building out this system I'd really
- [00:03:54.480 -> 00:03:58.480] appreciate if you would consider joining
- [00:03:56.239 -> 00:04:00.480] my membership okay I've talked enough
- [00:03:58.480 -> 00:04:01.920] about the theory and how Z has and works
- [00:04:00.480 -> 00:04:03.640] it's time to get into the actual
- [00:04:01.920 -> 00:04:05.640] practice of using this molecular note
- [00:04:03.640 -> 00:04:07.560] ticking system in a way that I found to
- [00:04:05.640 -> 00:04:10.000] be the most valuable and I hope you do
- [00:04:07.560 -> 00:04:12.079] too let's dive in I think that templates
- [00:04:10.000 -> 00:04:15.120] are the most useful when we keep them in
- [00:04:12.079 -> 00:04:18.600] mind of code we have different note
- [00:04:15.120 -> 00:04:20.199] types that are for each step of code we
- [00:04:18.600 -> 00:04:22.199] have some notes that are for capturing
- [00:04:20.199 -> 00:04:23.880] some notes that are for organizing some
- [00:04:22.199 -> 00:04:25.880] notes that are for distilling and some
- [00:04:23.880 -> 00:04:27.280] notes for expressing okay so let's start
- [00:04:25.880 -> 00:04:29.320] with the fleeting notes because this is
- [00:04:27.280 -> 00:04:30.600] the first step as part of capture so I'm
- [00:04:29.320 -> 00:04:32.960] going to start with the source note
- [00:04:30.600 -> 00:04:34.919] because that's my generic note for any
- [00:04:32.960 -> 00:04:36.400] information that I'm taking in and I've
- [00:04:34.919 -> 00:04:38.240] actually created a source template
- [00:04:36.400 -> 00:04:39.680] already in my obsidian for beginners
- [00:04:38.240 -> 00:04:41.880] video so I'm just going to use that one
- [00:04:39.680 -> 00:04:41.880] for
- [00:04:47.960 -> 00:04:52.520] now okay let's take a look at this note
- [00:04:50.400 -> 00:04:54.479] so my source template has a few key
- [00:04:52.520 -> 00:04:56.400] elements has a summary section a key
- [00:04:54.479 -> 00:04:58.080] takeaway section and a notes section
- [00:04:56.400 -> 00:05:00.320] then at the top under the front matter
- [00:04:58.080 -> 00:05:02.280] or the yaml I have a tag section and a
- [00:05:00.320 -> 00:05:04.720] reference link section so this reference
- [00:05:02.280 -> 00:05:06.680] link I can use to create for example a
- [00:05:04.720 -> 00:05:08.680] link to a book like how to take smart
- [00:05:06.680 -> 00:05:10.880] notes so this creates already the
- [00:05:08.680 -> 00:05:12.960] citation the bibliographic element
- [00:05:10.880 -> 00:05:14.639] inside of my reference manager which if
- [00:05:12.960 -> 00:05:16.080] you recall is part of the reference
- [00:05:14.639 -> 00:05:18.000] manager slip box you want to have a
- [00:05:16.080 -> 00:05:19.560] bibliographic note so what's nice about
- [00:05:18.000 -> 00:05:21.759] obsidian is that we can just use the
- [00:05:19.560 -> 00:05:23.400] reference link to add a bibliographic
- [00:05:21.759 -> 00:05:25.319] element to it because now if I click on
- [00:05:23.400 -> 00:05:28.080] how to take smart notes I can go and I
- [00:05:25.319 -> 00:05:30.039] can find this specific information so I
- [00:05:28.080 -> 00:05:32.400] would have to add here reference link
- [00:05:30.039 -> 00:05:34.199] and I could include a link to my
- [00:05:32.400 -> 00:05:35.960] reference manager something like Soo
- [00:05:34.199 -> 00:05:38.720] which would have a citation key so I can
- [00:05:35.960 -> 00:05:41.440] go back and find it or I could link to a
- [00:05:38.720 -> 00:05:43.240] website like Amazon or my own website
- [00:05:41.440 -> 00:05:45.160] where I have this book so the reference
- [00:05:43.240 -> 00:05:46.440] link is a key element of a source note
- [00:05:45.160 -> 00:05:48.360] and you can see here that I also have a
- [00:05:46.440 -> 00:05:50.240] tag for hashtag Source what this does is
- [00:05:48.360 -> 00:05:52.199] if I click on Source it'll pull up all
- [00:05:50.240 -> 00:05:54.440] of the list of sources that I have on
- [00:05:52.199 -> 00:05:56.639] the side here so tags provide some
- [00:05:54.440 -> 00:05:58.600] structure they provide a really easy way
- [00:05:56.639 -> 00:06:00.720] for me to effectively create a file
- [00:05:58.600 -> 00:06:02.280] system for any type of of tag so you can
- [00:06:00.720 -> 00:06:04.039] think of tags as an alternative to
- [00:06:02.280 -> 00:06:05.560] folders that you can also use folders
- [00:06:04.039 -> 00:06:07.680] too I have a whole video where I go into
- [00:06:05.560 -> 00:06:09.319] the distinction between tags and topics
- [00:06:07.680 -> 00:06:11.319] so I recommend checking out that video
- [00:06:09.319 -> 00:06:13.280] if you want to learn more but on that
- [00:06:11.319 -> 00:06:14.599] note we should also add a topic section
- [00:06:13.280 -> 00:06:16.520] because this is where you can start to
- [00:06:14.599 -> 00:06:18.319] get into what's called semantics
- [00:06:16.520 -> 00:06:20.919] semantic is the study of linguistic
- [00:06:18.319 -> 00:06:22.560] meaning it examines what meaning is and
- [00:06:20.919 -> 00:06:24.280] how words get their meaning the reason
- [00:06:22.560 -> 00:06:26.080] that I say topics provide a semantic
- [00:06:24.280 -> 00:06:28.080] element is because if you use topic
- [00:06:26.080 -> 00:06:31.280] notes you can then provide something
- [00:06:28.080 -> 00:06:35.199] like for example Psych ology as a a
- [00:06:31.280 -> 00:06:36.880] topic or or second brains as a topic or
- [00:06:35.199 -> 00:06:39.639] personal Knowledge Management Systems as
- [00:06:36.880 -> 00:06:41.840] a topic and I can use these semantics
- [00:06:39.639 -> 00:06:43.960] these words to help introduce an
- [00:06:41.840 -> 00:06:45.280] organization system for example if I go
- [00:06:43.960 -> 00:06:47.000] click into the topic of personal
- [00:06:45.280 -> 00:06:48.880] Knowledge Management I can go and I can
- [00:06:47.000 -> 00:06:51.240] find all of the notes that are linked to
- [00:06:48.880 -> 00:06:53.639] that particular concept so this allows
- [00:06:51.240 -> 00:06:56.000] me to use topics to begin producing an
- [00:06:53.639 -> 00:06:59.120] emergent structure in my system topic
- [00:06:56.000 -> 00:07:02.400] notes are notes that help organize with
- [00:06:59.120 -> 00:07:05.120] emergence and contain hash topic so I'll
- [00:07:02.400 -> 00:07:06.560] use a tag to indicate which are topics
- [00:07:05.120 -> 00:07:08.720] so that if I wanted to I could go
- [00:07:06.560 -> 00:07:10.759] through and click on the topic tag and
- [00:07:08.720 -> 00:07:12.520] find a list of all of my topics again I
- [00:07:10.759 -> 00:07:14.199] could also have a folder system for this
- [00:07:12.520 -> 00:07:15.280] which I'll show you in a moment so now
- [00:07:14.199 -> 00:07:17.400] I'm just going to delete this because
- [00:07:15.280 -> 00:07:19.039] this is my template note and what makes
- [00:07:17.400 -> 00:07:20.919] this a template note is that this is
- [00:07:19.039 -> 00:07:23.360] sitting inside my template folder and I
- [00:07:20.919 -> 00:07:26.840] can apply this template to any note so
- [00:07:23.360 -> 00:07:29.599] any time I come across a book a video a
- [00:07:26.840 -> 00:07:32.199] podcast a conversation and I'm
- [00:07:29.599 -> 00:07:34.160] generating information I'm drawing that
- [00:07:32.199 -> 00:07:35.919] information I'm internalizing it I
- [00:07:34.160 -> 00:07:37.639] create a source for it by using the
- [00:07:35.919 -> 00:07:38.879] source template and then I create a
- [00:07:37.639 -> 00:07:40.479] reference link to where I got the
- [00:07:38.879 -> 00:07:43.160] information from for my citation
- [00:07:40.479 -> 00:07:45.080] purposes and I tag it with specific
- [00:07:43.160 -> 00:07:47.720] topics that will help me organize the
- [00:07:45.080 -> 00:07:49.759] structure of related Concepts in this
- [00:07:47.720 -> 00:07:51.639] system because I read so many books I
- [00:07:49.759 -> 00:07:53.319] also like to have a book Source template
- [00:07:51.639 -> 00:07:55.919] and with my book Source template I like
- [00:07:53.319 -> 00:07:57.520] to add chapter specific notes so that I
- [00:07:55.919 -> 00:07:58.879] can have a bit more structure on where I
- [00:07:57.520 -> 00:08:00.639] got the information I'll include
- [00:07:58.879 -> 00:08:02.400] specific ele ments on the chapters that
- [00:08:00.639 -> 00:08:04.240] I'm reading so that as I go through I
- [00:08:02.400 -> 00:08:05.960] can copy down the quotes and then add my
- [00:08:04.240 -> 00:08:08.199] own notes and it this just helps me
- [00:08:05.960 -> 00:08:09.840] distinguish as a form of fleeing note
- [00:08:08.199 -> 00:08:12.120] where I'm capturing the quotes and
- [00:08:09.840 -> 00:08:14.000] capturing the ideas and the essence but
- [00:08:12.120 -> 00:08:15.840] also capturing my own ideas along the
- [00:08:14.000 -> 00:08:17.599] way in a way that is really easy for me
- [00:08:15.840 -> 00:08:20.319] to keep separate with this I could also
- [00:08:17.599 -> 00:08:22.240] add the tag hash book and then when I
- [00:08:20.319 -> 00:08:23.720] apply this book Source template it will
- [00:08:22.240 -> 00:08:25.639] have both tags in it and then I can
- [00:08:23.720 -> 00:08:27.479] easily find all of the notes that have
- [00:08:25.639 -> 00:08:29.720] specific books related to them and as
- [00:08:27.479 -> 00:08:31.039] one other quick note what I find really
- [00:08:29.720 -> 00:08:33.039] helpful is when I'm reading something
- [00:08:31.039 -> 00:08:34.919] like a book or watching a YouTube video
- [00:08:33.039 -> 00:08:37.200] I have three tiers for how I take my
- [00:08:34.919 -> 00:08:39.159] notes the first tier is the main level
- [00:08:37.200 -> 00:08:40.719] and this is the current concept of
- [00:08:39.159 -> 00:08:42.959] discussion you can think of this like a
- [00:08:40.719 -> 00:08:45.600] a heading or a title then I have the
- [00:08:42.959 -> 00:08:47.240] specific quote plus the page number or
- [00:08:45.600 -> 00:08:49.760] timestamp that I got the information
- [00:08:47.240 -> 00:08:52.959] from and then in my bottom level I have
- [00:08:49.760 -> 00:08:54.560] my ideas thoughts and insights so what's
- [00:08:52.959 -> 00:08:56.519] really nice about using this system for
- [00:08:54.560 -> 00:08:58.560] myself is that when I go back and read
- [00:08:56.519 -> 00:09:00.279] my notes I always know whether I got the
- [00:08:58.560 -> 00:09:02.000] information from someone else if it's in
- [00:09:00.279 -> 00:09:04.360] these first two tiers or if it's one of
- [00:09:02.000 -> 00:09:05.839] my own ideas then at the bottom I also
- [00:09:04.360 -> 00:09:07.240] include a separate section that
- [00:09:05.839 -> 00:09:09.600] specifically notes and this would be
- [00:09:07.240 -> 00:09:11.839] including only my own ideas again the
- [00:09:09.600 -> 00:09:13.720] goal here is to be able to keep track of
- [00:09:11.839 -> 00:09:15.480] what is coming from an external Source
- [00:09:13.720 -> 00:09:17.040] like these first two levels and what's
- [00:09:15.480 -> 00:09:19.079] coming from an internal source which is
- [00:09:17.040 -> 00:09:21.120] myself this is just a good way to track
- [00:09:19.079 -> 00:09:23.320] your own originality and I find that
- [00:09:21.120 -> 00:09:25.160] very valuable okay and then we also have
- [00:09:23.320 -> 00:09:26.640] as a fleeting note the daily note and I
- [00:09:25.160 -> 00:09:29.680] also have a daily note template that I
- [00:09:26.640 -> 00:09:31.040] created inside of my tutorial video on
- [00:09:29.680 -> 00:09:32.360] obsidian for beginners so if you're
- [00:09:31.040 -> 00:09:33.920] interested in learning more about daily
- [00:09:32.360 -> 00:09:35.880] notes I recommend checking out that
- [00:09:33.920 -> 00:09:37.079] video so this is my daily note template
- [00:09:35.880 -> 00:09:38.680] again you can see it's got the daily
- [00:09:37.079 -> 00:09:39.920] note tag so that's just an easy way for
- [00:09:38.680 -> 00:09:41.720] me to see all the notes that have been
- [00:09:39.920 -> 00:09:44.399] created that are daily notes I have a
- [00:09:41.720 -> 00:09:46.440] section for tasks ideas favorite moments
- [00:09:44.399 -> 00:09:48.640] a journal you can put whatever you want
- [00:09:46.440 -> 00:09:51.120] inside this template here for myself my
- [00:09:48.640 -> 00:09:53.079] main fleeting note section is under the
- [00:09:51.120 -> 00:09:55.720] ideas section and that's where I'll go
- [00:09:53.079 -> 00:09:57.320] through and I'll write down hash idea
- [00:09:55.720 -> 00:09:58.959] and if I have an idea then I know that I
- [00:09:57.320 -> 00:10:00.760] can always click on this and go back and
- [00:09:58.959 -> 00:10:02.880] find all of the notes that contain the
- [00:10:00.760 -> 00:10:04.640] hashtag idea so that this could be a
- [00:10:02.880 -> 00:10:06.839] jumping off point for me to begin
- [00:10:04.640 -> 00:10:09.120] creating a molecule or a permanent note
- [00:10:06.839 -> 00:10:11.040] in my system I'll take these ideas and
- [00:10:09.120 -> 00:10:13.240] then I'll find specific atoms that
- [00:10:11.040 -> 00:10:15.120] relate to that idea and combine them
- [00:10:13.240 -> 00:10:16.839] together to produce molecules this is a
- [00:10:15.120 -> 00:10:18.480] basic version of The Daily note mine is
- [00:10:16.839 -> 00:10:20.200] actually a little more complicated but
- [00:10:18.480 -> 00:10:21.760] I'll get into that in another video and
- [00:10:20.200 -> 00:10:24.320] then as another component of a fleeting
- [00:10:21.760 -> 00:10:25.800] note we could just have a new blank note
- [00:10:24.320 -> 00:10:27.360] this is where you go and you just have a
- [00:10:25.800 -> 00:10:28.959] new idea and perhaps you don't have time
- [00:10:27.360 -> 00:10:30.959] to drop it into your daily note and it's
- [00:10:28.959 -> 00:10:32.760] not coming from a particular Source or
- [00:10:30.959 -> 00:10:34.560] it's hard to identify where the source
- [00:10:32.760 -> 00:10:36.079] is you just quickly want to jot
- [00:10:34.560 -> 00:10:38.040] something down so you don't forget it
- [00:10:36.079 -> 00:10:40.079] then you can just create a new note and
- [00:10:38.040 -> 00:10:43.240] go back to it later so if you wanted you
- [00:10:40.079 -> 00:10:44.560] could add for example hash fleeting note
- [00:10:43.240 -> 00:10:46.279] and then you'd be able to find all the
- [00:10:44.560 -> 00:10:47.880] notes that you would like to sort
- [00:10:46.279 -> 00:10:50.800] through later as part of your fleeting
- [00:10:47.880 -> 00:10:52.720] note inbox I'll explain inboxes after we
- [00:10:50.800 -> 00:10:54.360] go through the rest of the templates in
- [00:10:52.720 -> 00:10:56.040] some situations project notes could also
- [00:10:54.360 -> 00:10:58.320] be fleeting notes where you've gone
- [00:10:56.040 -> 00:11:00.200] through and you have new ideas for
- [00:10:58.320 -> 00:11:02.360] something like a new article a new
- [00:11:00.200 -> 00:11:04.240] YouTube video something for work that
- [00:11:02.360 -> 00:11:06.519] you've solved a problem and you want to
- [00:11:04.240 -> 00:11:08.519] quickly jot down your ideas and it's all
- [00:11:06.519 -> 00:11:10.600] under a specific project name then
- [00:11:08.519 -> 00:11:12.320] project notes can become a fleeting note
- [00:11:10.600 -> 00:11:13.720] as well again the goal here is not to
- [00:11:12.320 -> 00:11:16.000] have something that's completely set in
- [00:11:13.720 -> 00:11:17.360] stone based on how I'm describing it but
- [00:11:16.000 -> 00:11:19.560] to generate something that works best
- [00:11:17.360 -> 00:11:21.760] for you so I hope that some combination
- [00:11:19.560 -> 00:11:23.760] of these fleeting notes you find helpful
- [00:11:21.760 -> 00:11:25.959] the next part of code is organization
- [00:11:23.760 -> 00:11:27.079] which is save for Action ability and
- [00:11:25.959 -> 00:11:29.680] I've already gone through this quite a
- [00:11:27.079 -> 00:11:31.399] bit with topic notes and with tags and I
- [00:11:29.680 -> 00:11:33.200] explain a lot more in my topics versus
- [00:11:31.399 -> 00:11:35.000] tags video really what we're dealing
- [00:11:33.200 -> 00:11:37.600] with for organization is how this whole
- [00:11:35.000 -> 00:11:39.120] system flows together so we're kind of
- [00:11:37.600 -> 00:11:41.560] dealing with that throughout this entire
- [00:11:39.120 -> 00:11:43.360] video but as a main form of organization
- [00:11:41.560 -> 00:11:45.519] if you don't want to use tags we can
- [00:11:43.360 -> 00:11:47.360] introduce folders on the side here where
- [00:11:45.519 -> 00:11:49.760] I can use a community plugin called the
- [00:11:47.360 -> 00:11:52.120] auton note mover plugin to automatically
- [00:11:49.760 -> 00:11:54.240] move notes to a specific folder based on
- [00:11:52.120 -> 00:11:56.360] the rules that I've set so for example I
- [00:11:54.240 -> 00:11:58.680] have my sources folder and I can add the
- [00:11:56.360 -> 00:12:00.600] tag hashtag source and it will
- [00:11:58.680 -> 00:12:02.680] automatically move any file that has
- [00:12:00.600 -> 00:12:04.160] hashtag Source into the sources folder
- [00:12:02.680 -> 00:12:06.079] so effectively what you can do is you
- [00:12:04.160 -> 00:12:07.880] can automatically generate an inbox for
- [00:12:06.079 -> 00:12:10.240] every source and you can do the same
- [00:12:07.880 -> 00:12:12.440] thing for fleeting nodes for atoms for
- [00:12:10.240 -> 00:12:13.680] molecules and that's what I'll do
- [00:12:12.440 -> 00:12:15.760] quickly at the end but if you want to
- [00:12:13.680 -> 00:12:17.519] see more about the auton not mover I
- [00:12:15.760 -> 00:12:20.160] have a YouTube video that goes into
- [00:12:17.519 -> 00:12:21.880] depth on automatic inboxes and indexes
- [00:12:20.160 -> 00:12:24.040] using the auton note mover plugin
- [00:12:21.880 -> 00:12:25.480] templator and data view so I recommend
- [00:12:24.040 -> 00:12:27.279] watching that video as a lot of people
- [00:12:25.480 -> 00:12:28.560] have found it really helpful okay so I
- [00:12:27.279 -> 00:12:30.639] just quickly went through here and
- [00:12:28.560 -> 00:12:32.399] created a new folder for each of my
- [00:12:30.639 -> 00:12:34.279] different note Primitives so what that
- [00:12:32.399 -> 00:12:36.079] means is as part of the organization
- [00:12:34.279 -> 00:12:37.839] component if I have a different hashtag
- [00:12:36.079 -> 00:12:39.880] for each of my different not types and I
- [00:12:37.839 -> 00:12:42.440] use the auto note mover plugin I can
- [00:12:39.880 -> 00:12:44.199] automatically send each new note that I
- [00:12:42.440 -> 00:12:45.920] create using the source template or the
- [00:12:44.199 -> 00:12:47.639] daily note template or the fleeting note
- [00:12:45.920 -> 00:12:49.800] template and it'll automatically get
- [00:12:47.639 -> 00:12:51.360] organized into its appropriate location
- [00:12:49.800 -> 00:12:52.800] now some people just prefer to use tags
- [00:12:51.360 -> 00:12:54.839] rather than folders but I like being
- [00:12:52.800 -> 00:12:57.360] able to click into my molecule folder
- [00:12:54.839 -> 00:12:58.800] and then specifically explore all of my
- [00:12:57.360 -> 00:13:01.240] permanent notes that's one of the
- [00:12:58.800 -> 00:13:03.399] benefits of using a zetting system is
- [00:13:01.240 -> 00:13:05.800] that you're able to reduce information
- [00:13:03.399 -> 00:13:07.720] by reviewing knowledge and Distilling
- [00:13:05.800 -> 00:13:09.920] your own work already I wanted to
- [00:13:07.720 -> 00:13:12.600] briefly touch on the distill component
- [00:13:09.920 -> 00:13:14.800] of code of capture organized distill
- [00:13:12.600 -> 00:13:16.680] Express this is typically the point in
- [00:13:14.800 -> 00:13:19.320] the zc casting system where people tend
- [00:13:16.680 -> 00:13:20.800] to get the most confused and it's
- [00:13:19.320 -> 00:13:22.839] understandable because it's also the
- [00:13:20.800 -> 00:13:24.800] hardest thing to explain it's one of
- [00:13:22.839 -> 00:13:26.880] those things that you can only really
- [00:13:24.800 -> 00:13:28.839] understand by doing it and in a sense
- [00:13:26.880 -> 00:13:30.320] the distillation part is known as the
- [00:13:28.839 -> 00:13:32.079] gener generation effect when we
- [00:13:30.320 -> 00:13:34.680] translate information from others into
- [00:13:32.079 -> 00:13:36.920] our own words we understand and remember
- [00:13:34.680 -> 00:13:38.480] the information better this is the true
- [00:13:36.920 -> 00:13:40.320] beginning of knowledge which is the
- [00:13:38.480 -> 00:13:42.680] result of making connections between
- [00:13:40.320 -> 00:13:45.160] pieces of information these connections
- [00:13:42.680 -> 00:13:46.440] are far more valuable if the connections
- [00:13:45.160 -> 00:13:48.279] that you're making between the different
- [00:13:46.440 -> 00:13:50.240] notes are notes that you've already put
- [00:13:48.279 -> 00:13:52.199] into your own words distillation is the
- [00:13:50.240 -> 00:13:54.279] most important part of the zle Casten
- [00:13:52.199 -> 00:13:56.639] system because this is where we actually
- [00:13:54.279 -> 00:13:58.079] build the building blocks of the notes
- [00:13:56.639 -> 00:14:00.560] that we're going to be using in note
- [00:13:58.079 -> 00:14:02.600] sequences to create original works I'll
- [00:14:00.560 -> 00:14:04.800] touch more on Note sequences later but
- [00:14:02.600 -> 00:14:06.880] the key here is that we're standardizing
- [00:14:04.800 -> 00:14:08.839] something that will help us augment our
- [00:14:06.880 -> 00:14:10.680] personal Knowledge Management as we
- [00:14:08.839 -> 00:14:12.279] practically use this system by
- [00:14:10.680 -> 00:14:14.600] definition the generation effect is
- [00:14:12.279 -> 00:14:16.399] something that you must do yourself you
- [00:14:14.600 -> 00:14:18.480] have to take the concept and translate
- [00:14:16.399 -> 00:14:20.240] it into your own words it's something
- [00:14:18.480 -> 00:14:22.560] that you can only really gain knowledge
- [00:14:20.240 -> 00:14:25.000] and wisdom if you do it yourself you
- [00:14:22.560 -> 00:14:27.440] learn by doing my suggestion is after
- [00:14:25.000 -> 00:14:29.639] you read a book after you watch a movie
- [00:14:27.440 -> 00:14:31.160] or listen to a podcast and you have
- [00:14:29.639 -> 00:14:33.399] insights that you're jotting down as
- [00:14:31.160 -> 00:14:35.639] part of your fleeting notes take time to
- [00:14:33.399 -> 00:14:38.480] go through those notes and distill the
- [00:14:35.639 -> 00:14:40.320] parts that resonated into your own words
- [00:14:38.480 -> 00:14:42.360] into your permanent notes so that you
- [00:14:40.320 -> 00:14:43.959] can go back later and take all of the
- [00:14:42.360 -> 00:14:45.360] building blocks that you've created and
- [00:14:43.959 -> 00:14:47.360] build whatever it is you're interested
- [00:14:45.360 -> 00:14:49.399] in writing about by distilling the value
- [00:14:47.360 -> 00:14:52.079] into your own words you can create a
- [00:14:49.399 -> 00:14:53.680] block that future U can use and future U
- [00:14:52.079 -> 00:14:56.320] will thank you for the work that you put
- [00:14:53.680 -> 00:14:57.680] in now while it's fresh in your mind
- [00:14:56.320 -> 00:15:00.240] okay let's take a deeper look at the
- [00:14:57.680 -> 00:15:02.279] distillation process in ular thatle cast
- [00:15:00.240 -> 00:15:04.519] now let's get into the distillation this
- [00:15:02.279 -> 00:15:06.480] is where you can see here that it says
- [00:15:04.519 -> 00:15:07.839] find the essence and that's really what
- [00:15:06.480 -> 00:15:09.880] we're trying to do with all of this is
- [00:15:07.839 -> 00:15:12.720] we're trying to distill we're trying to
- [00:15:09.880 -> 00:15:15.320] reduce complexity and improve Insight
- [00:15:12.720 -> 00:15:16.959] improve action ability let's create the
- [00:15:15.320 -> 00:15:18.639] atom template I quickly added some more
- [00:15:16.959 -> 00:15:20.199] properties into the metadata here the
- [00:15:18.639 -> 00:15:22.480] first thing we want to do is create an
- [00:15:20.199 -> 00:15:24.120] atom tag and I've also included a page
- [00:15:22.480 -> 00:15:26.199] number that goes along with this
- [00:15:24.120 -> 00:15:28.680] reference link so I can reference a
- [00:15:26.199 -> 00:15:30.959] specific source and then I can include
- [00:15:28.680 -> 00:15:32.920] the specific page number that the quote
- [00:15:30.959 -> 00:15:35.519] or information was found on so the types
- [00:15:32.920 -> 00:15:38.480] of nodes that go in here would be quotes
- [00:15:35.519 -> 00:15:41.240] Concepts key takeaways and one of the
- [00:15:38.480 -> 00:15:44.199] main elements here is that we want to
- [00:15:41.240 -> 00:15:45.560] convert the quotes into our own words so
- [00:15:44.199 -> 00:15:47.759] what we can do is if there's a quote
- [00:15:45.560 -> 00:15:50.120] inside of a source we can extract an
- [00:15:47.759 -> 00:15:52.360] atom from that source to create a single
- [00:15:50.120 -> 00:15:54.480] concept this is where we truly start to
- [00:15:52.360 -> 00:15:56.759] get into Atomic node taking where we
- [00:15:54.480 -> 00:16:00.079] want to have each atom be its own
- [00:15:56.759 -> 00:16:02.000] singular idea or con concept so this is
- [00:16:00.079 -> 00:16:04.399] also referred to as the generation
- [00:16:02.000 -> 00:16:06.680] effect where if we take time to distill
- [00:16:04.399 -> 00:16:08.759] and translate a quote into our own words
- [00:16:06.680 -> 00:16:10.720] we remember it a lot better and just as
- [00:16:08.759 -> 00:16:11.920] another quote to throw in here if you
- [00:16:10.720 -> 00:16:13.920] want to learn something you write it
- [00:16:11.920 -> 00:16:15.279] down if you want to really understand
- [00:16:13.920 -> 00:16:17.759] something you have to translate it into
- [00:16:15.279 -> 00:16:19.519] your own words so this comes from the
- [00:16:17.759 -> 00:16:21.240] book how to take smart notes in my
- [00:16:19.519 -> 00:16:23.360] source note on how to take smart notes I
- [00:16:21.240 -> 00:16:25.279] had this quote in there so if I wanted
- [00:16:23.360 -> 00:16:27.959] to extract this into an atom I could
- [00:16:25.279 -> 00:16:29.160] translate this into my own Atomic note
- [00:16:27.959 -> 00:16:30.319] where learning comes from under
- [00:16:29.160 -> 00:16:31.959] understanding and understanding is
- [00:16:30.319 -> 00:16:33.920] derived from translating Concepts into
- [00:16:31.959 -> 00:16:35.720] your own words now what I would do is I
- [00:16:33.920 -> 00:16:38.040] would go back and create a reference
- [00:16:35.720 -> 00:16:39.839] link to how to take smart notes and
- [00:16:38.040 -> 00:16:41.560] write down the page that I got this from
- [00:16:39.839 -> 00:16:43.360] which I have to look up but let's just
- [00:16:41.560 -> 00:16:46.000] say it was page 90 then I could include
- [00:16:43.360 -> 00:16:48.199] a topic which could be writing or it
- [00:16:46.000 -> 00:16:50.040] could be personal Knowledge Management
- [00:16:48.199 -> 00:16:51.720] System and then I would just leave it at
- [00:16:50.040 -> 00:16:53.519] that I would remove all of this
- [00:16:51.720 -> 00:16:55.160] additional context and I could if I
- [00:16:53.519 -> 00:16:57.040] wanted to include the quote below for
- [00:16:55.160 -> 00:16:58.519] the original quote but again the goal
- [00:16:57.040 -> 00:17:00.440] here is that by using the generation
- [00:16:58.519 -> 00:17:02.120] effect I can put something into my own
- [00:17:00.440 -> 00:17:04.280] words so that this becomes more
- [00:17:02.120 -> 00:17:05.839] applicable to me in the future so you
- [00:17:04.280 -> 00:17:07.760] can put whatever you want in here in
- [00:17:05.839 -> 00:17:09.280] terms of how you would like to remind
- [00:17:07.760 -> 00:17:11.760] yourself of what the point of this is
- [00:17:09.280 -> 00:17:13.079] but my Atomic literature node template
- [00:17:11.760 -> 00:17:14.919] basically looks like this where I don't
- [00:17:13.079 -> 00:17:17.319] have any more information it's the most
- [00:17:14.919 -> 00:17:18.760] basic form of notes but key elements
- [00:17:17.319 -> 00:17:22.520] that I would put in here would be
- [00:17:18.760 -> 00:17:25.480] definitions Concepts principles mental
- [00:17:22.520 -> 00:17:26.600] models historical facts really anything
- [00:17:25.480 -> 00:17:28.360] that could be distilled down to a
- [00:17:26.600 -> 00:17:32.480] singular thing so you can really think
- [00:17:28.360 -> 00:17:34.559] of atom as a core of the idea or concept
- [00:17:32.480 -> 00:17:36.000] plus the citation of where it came from
- [00:17:34.559 -> 00:17:38.080] and then let's just move that into the
- [00:17:36.000 -> 00:17:40.240] template folder okay now the second part
- [00:17:38.080 -> 00:17:42.760] of the distillation element is the
- [00:17:40.240 -> 00:17:44.640] molecule so let's convert that to a file
- [00:17:42.760 -> 00:17:46.400] and this is very similar to the atom so
- [00:17:44.640 -> 00:17:48.960] I'm going to just insert the atom
- [00:17:46.400 -> 00:17:51.760] template and then change this tag to
- [00:17:48.960 -> 00:17:53.880] hashtag molecule and we can remove page
- [00:17:51.760 -> 00:17:55.919] number can remove reference link and we
- [00:17:53.880 -> 00:17:57.720] can keep topics so molecules are also
- [00:17:55.919 -> 00:17:59.280] quite simple and the reason for this is
- [00:17:57.720 -> 00:18:01.080] because we want to identif Iden ify
- [00:17:59.280 -> 00:18:02.840] insights ideas or connections between
- [00:18:01.080 -> 00:18:04.360] atoms I've just included some notes here
- [00:18:02.840 -> 00:18:07.039] so that it's help more helpful for you
- [00:18:04.360 -> 00:18:09.400] you can kind of see what the makeup is
- [00:18:07.039 -> 00:18:11.720] what the anatomy of a molecule is and I
- [00:18:09.400 -> 00:18:14.919] just want to remind you that we want to
- [00:18:11.720 -> 00:18:17.000] write as if for someone else we want to
- [00:18:14.919 -> 00:18:19.280] write for print and the reason for this
- [00:18:17.000 -> 00:18:20.960] is that each of these molecules can be
- [00:18:19.280 -> 00:18:23.360] combined in different ways like the Lego
- [00:18:20.960 -> 00:18:24.840] block analogy I gave before so if we're
- [00:18:23.360 -> 00:18:26.679] writing as if it's for someone else
- [00:18:24.840 -> 00:18:28.480] which could be for future us for future
- [00:18:26.679 -> 00:18:30.720] me and we want to write it as if it's
- [00:18:28.480 -> 00:18:32.400] for print or for publication then when
- [00:18:30.720 -> 00:18:34.679] we go back and we start combining those
- [00:18:32.400 -> 00:18:36.919] Lego blocks we have to do far less
- [00:18:34.679 -> 00:18:39.280] editing because we can just connect
- [00:18:36.919 -> 00:18:42.159] things rather than having to try to
- [00:18:39.280 -> 00:18:44.520] reframe or paraphrase or convert the
- [00:18:42.159 -> 00:18:46.760] previous ideas into a publication form
- [00:18:44.520 -> 00:18:48.640] effectively by doing the distillation by
- [00:18:46.760 -> 00:18:51.159] connecting the atomic nodes the atom
- [00:18:48.640 -> 00:18:53.280] nodes with the molecules and framing it
- [00:18:51.159 -> 00:18:55.440] as if we were writing it for publication
- [00:18:53.280 -> 00:18:57.440] we can save our future selves a ton of
- [00:18:55.440 -> 00:18:59.080] time and we can start working on many
- [00:18:57.440 -> 00:19:00.960] different Publications at the same time
- [00:18:59.080 -> 00:19:03.280] as we just piece together the different
- [00:19:00.960 -> 00:19:05.919] ideas the different insights and just as
- [00:19:03.280 -> 00:19:07.360] a quick quote to help elaborate on this
- [00:19:05.919 -> 00:19:09.600] concept here's a quote from Nicholas
- [00:19:07.360 -> 00:19:11.799] Lumen who was the creator of the zle
- [00:19:09.600 -> 00:19:14.480] Casten system and he said I always have
- [00:19:11.799 -> 00:19:16.679] a slip of paper at hand in which I note
- [00:19:14.480 -> 00:19:18.720] down the ideas of certain pages on the
- [00:19:16.679 -> 00:19:20.600] back I write the bibliographic details
- [00:19:18.720 -> 00:19:22.280] so this is the literature note section
- [00:19:20.600 -> 00:19:23.720] after finishing the book I go through my
- [00:19:22.280 -> 00:19:25.400] notes and think how these notes might be
- [00:19:23.720 -> 00:19:27.799] relevant for already written notes in
- [00:19:25.400 -> 00:19:29.480] the slip box it means that I always read
- [00:19:27.799 -> 00:19:31.440] with an eye of possible M Connections in
- [00:19:29.480 -> 00:19:33.120] the slip box what this means is that as
- [00:19:31.440 -> 00:19:35.039] you go through your atoms as you go
- [00:19:33.120 -> 00:19:36.960] through and you distill your fleeting
- [00:19:35.039 -> 00:19:38.360] notes into literature notes you can then
- [00:19:36.960 -> 00:19:40.760] read through those literature notes with
- [00:19:38.360 -> 00:19:42.039] an eye for your problems and your ideas
- [00:19:40.760 -> 00:19:43.799] and your Concepts the things that you're
- [00:19:42.039 -> 00:19:45.960] working on like your project notes or
- [00:19:43.799 -> 00:19:47.440] your papers or your YouTube videos
- [00:19:45.960 -> 00:19:49.840] whatever it is you want to create
- [00:19:47.440 -> 00:19:52.039] whatever is at the top of your Bloom's
- [00:19:49.840 -> 00:19:54.559] taxonomy which is this pyramid here
- [00:19:52.039 -> 00:19:56.440] Whatever Gets you to that create phase
- [00:19:54.559 -> 00:19:59.440] that's the idea that you want to keep in
- [00:19:56.440 -> 00:20:01.000] mind that's what you want to read with
- [00:19:59.440 -> 00:20:03.559] an eye of possible Connections in your
- [00:20:01.000 -> 00:20:05.640] slip box you can really think of your
- [00:20:03.559 -> 00:20:09.000] molecule your permanent notes in the
- [00:20:05.640 -> 00:20:11.640] zalasin form as the idea generator or
- [00:20:09.000 -> 00:20:13.559] external mind or your thinking box
- [00:20:11.640 -> 00:20:14.960] whatever the phrasing is for you it
- [00:20:13.559 -> 00:20:16.480] doesn't matter it's something that
- [00:20:14.960 -> 00:20:18.559] resonates with you something where you
- [00:20:16.480 -> 00:20:20.039] know that you can just go and you can
- [00:20:18.559 -> 00:20:22.039] click on your molecule folder that
- [00:20:20.039 -> 00:20:23.880] contains all of these permanent notes
- [00:20:22.039 -> 00:20:25.760] and you can read through only those
- [00:20:23.880 -> 00:20:27.880] permanent notes with an eye of making
- [00:20:25.760 -> 00:20:30.240] more connections between them over time
- [00:20:27.880 -> 00:20:31.799] you'll really start to generate a huge
- [00:20:30.240 -> 00:20:33.799] amount of connections between all of
- [00:20:31.799 -> 00:20:35.640] your notes in a way that you'll reach a
- [00:20:33.799 -> 00:20:37.840] critical mass of ideas that you'll
- [00:20:35.640 -> 00:20:39.840] really start to have one idea come after
- [00:20:37.840 -> 00:20:42.520] another this is what makes this system
- [00:20:39.840 -> 00:20:44.480] so emergent where patterns begin to
- [00:20:42.520 -> 00:20:46.240] emerge over time as another example
- [00:20:44.480 -> 00:20:48.480] that's related to this I'll create a new
- [00:20:46.240 -> 00:20:51.520] note called notes as ideas and I'll
- [00:20:48.480 -> 00:20:54.120] insert template of atom and this is a
- [00:20:51.520 -> 00:20:55.760] quote from how to take smart notes on
- [00:20:54.120 -> 00:20:57.440] permanent notes again the reference link
- [00:20:55.760 -> 00:20:59.960] would be how to take smart notes the
- [00:20:57.440 -> 00:21:01.960] page number you can see here is 43 and
- [00:20:59.960 -> 00:21:03.679] the concept is second brain personal
- [00:21:01.960 -> 00:21:05.559] Knowledge Management System and the
- [00:21:03.679 -> 00:21:07.360] quote is that permanent notes are no
- [00:21:05.559 -> 00:21:09.400] longer reminders of thoughts or ideas
- [00:21:07.360 -> 00:21:11.440] but contain the actual thought or idea
- [00:21:09.400 -> 00:21:13.840] in written form so I might call this
- [00:21:11.440 -> 00:21:16.080] concept permanent notes equals ideas and
- [00:21:13.840 -> 00:21:17.799] the idea here is that I'm not just
- [00:21:16.080 -> 00:21:19.360] writing down notes that I've captured as
- [00:21:17.799 -> 00:21:21.520] a fleeting note to remind me of
- [00:21:19.360 -> 00:21:23.400] something I've thought of in the past
- [00:21:21.520 -> 00:21:25.840] but to actually crystalize that
- [00:21:23.400 -> 00:21:28.080] information into a single note so that I
- [00:21:25.840 -> 00:21:30.039] can go back to it in the future and it's
- [00:21:28.080 -> 00:21:31.840] like I'm walking through my thoughts I'm
- [00:21:30.039 -> 00:21:34.080] flipping through the pages of my own
- [00:21:31.840 -> 00:21:35.919] second brain it's the true core of the
- [00:21:34.080 -> 00:21:39.200] idea then I can take the core of that
- [00:21:35.919 -> 00:21:42.080] idea and connect this concept to other
- [00:21:39.200 -> 00:21:45.000] Concepts throughout my slip box through
- [00:21:42.080 -> 00:21:47.440] my permanent note box my molecule box
- [00:21:45.000 -> 00:21:49.559] and generate new ideas or insights and
- [00:21:47.440 -> 00:21:51.000] get that emergent critical mass going
- [00:21:49.559 -> 00:21:52.960] and in this case here the title is
- [00:21:51.000 -> 00:21:55.000] actually sufficient I think to summarize
- [00:21:52.960 -> 00:21:57.039] this particular quote so I would just
- [00:21:55.000 -> 00:21:59.760] leave this as it is and then if I were
- [00:21:57.039 -> 00:22:01.559] to use this inside of my molecule I
- [00:21:59.760 -> 00:22:03.840] would just reference it permanent notes
- [00:22:01.559 -> 00:22:05.520] equals ideas and if I wanted to I could
- [00:22:03.840 -> 00:22:09.080] create an alias for this note and I
- [00:22:05.520 -> 00:22:11.120] could maybe call it permanent notes are
- [00:22:09.080 -> 00:22:13.760] crystallized thought that way I'm able
- [00:22:11.120 -> 00:22:15.480] to keep the context of that particular
- [00:22:13.760 -> 00:22:17.760] Atomic note the idea that permanent
- [00:22:15.480 -> 00:22:19.360] notes equals ideas but I can frame it in
- [00:22:17.760 -> 00:22:21.159] a way that's more applicable for this
- [00:22:19.360 -> 00:22:22.679] particular molecule and one of the most
- [00:22:21.159 -> 00:22:24.559] important part of permanent notes is
- [00:22:22.679 -> 00:22:26.440] making those connections so again we
- [00:22:24.559 -> 00:22:28.559] don't want to have any orphin notes what
- [00:22:26.440 -> 00:22:30.080] we want to do is we want to make
- [00:22:28.559 -> 00:22:32.039] connections between molecules and the
- [00:22:30.080 -> 00:22:34.799] more connections we have the more
- [00:22:32.039 -> 00:22:37.600] exponential our thinking box can become
- [00:22:34.799 -> 00:22:39.760] if you were to try and gauge note taking
- [00:22:37.600 -> 00:22:41.720] productivity the best way to do this
- [00:22:39.760 -> 00:22:43.240] would be to measure the number of
- [00:22:41.720 -> 00:22:45.080] permanent notes that you create the
- [00:22:43.240 -> 00:22:46.880] number of crystallized insights that you
- [00:22:45.080 -> 00:22:49.440] generate based on your fleeting notes
- [00:22:46.880 -> 00:22:51.600] and ideas related to your projects the
- [00:22:49.440 -> 00:22:53.679] whole goal of this entire system is try
- [00:22:51.600 -> 00:22:55.840] to make as many high quality permanent
- [00:22:53.679 -> 00:22:57.720] nodes as possible as many highquality
- [00:22:55.840 -> 00:23:00.559] Lego bricks as possible the way I think
- [00:22:57.720 -> 00:23:02.520] of it is like that scene in Oppenheimer
- [00:23:00.559 -> 00:23:04.080] where they're trying to measure the
- [00:23:02.520 -> 00:23:06.159] amount of plutonium they need in order
- [00:23:04.080 -> 00:23:09.080] to create a critical mass for the atomic
- [00:23:06.159 -> 00:23:10.960] bomb and he has a jar that he adds
- [00:23:09.080 -> 00:23:12.480] marbles to over time you can kind of
- [00:23:10.960 -> 00:23:15.159] think of that like your thinking box
- [00:23:12.480 -> 00:23:17.840] your idea generator once that jar gets
- [00:23:15.159 -> 00:23:19.760] full of highquality molecules eventually
- [00:23:17.840 -> 00:23:21.200] you'll hit a critical mass where you'll
- [00:23:19.760 -> 00:23:22.960] spend so much time making new
- [00:23:21.200 -> 00:23:24.600] connections between new things that
- [00:23:22.960 -> 00:23:26.240] you'll never run out of things to write
- [00:23:24.600 -> 00:23:28.120] about for the rest of your life and
- [00:23:26.240 -> 00:23:30.440] that's where we get into the final stage
- [00:23:28.120 -> 00:23:33.200] of the code method as it applies to my
- [00:23:30.440 -> 00:23:34.760] molecular zle Casten the Alloys or
- [00:23:33.200 -> 00:23:37.080] publishable notes the template for
- [00:23:34.760 -> 00:23:39.559] Alloys or a publishable note is going to
- [00:23:37.080 -> 00:23:41.480] vary depending on its output use case
- [00:23:39.559 -> 00:23:46.440] this could be for social media
- [00:23:41.480 -> 00:23:48.080] newsletter YouTube emails articles blogs
- [00:23:46.440 -> 00:23:49.640] the list is literally endless here the
- [00:23:48.080 -> 00:23:51.320] point is that as you go through and take
- [00:23:49.640 -> 00:23:53.880] your fleeting notes based on the source
- [00:23:51.320 -> 00:23:55.559] information and distill it into atoms
- [00:23:53.880 -> 00:23:57.520] the literature notes on the key Concepts
- [00:23:55.559 -> 00:23:59.200] you're learning about the atomic notes
- [00:23:57.520 -> 00:24:00.840] and you make Con connections between
- [00:23:59.200 -> 00:24:02.440] those atomic notes and your own ideas
- [00:24:00.840 -> 00:24:04.320] based on your projects to produce
- [00:24:02.440 -> 00:24:06.799] molecules you want to take those
- [00:24:04.320 -> 00:24:09.159] molecules and base on the project ideas
- [00:24:06.799 -> 00:24:11.240] that you have use them to publish new
- [00:24:09.159 -> 00:24:13.760] and original thinking so as an example
- [00:24:11.240 -> 00:24:15.559] of an alloy I'll show you my newsletter
- [00:24:13.760 -> 00:24:17.320] template so this is my recalibrating
- [00:24:15.559 -> 00:24:19.120] newsletter template which I like to
- [00:24:17.320 -> 00:24:21.039] think of as an alloy because my
- [00:24:19.120 -> 00:24:23.039] newsletters can be somewhat long
- [00:24:21.039 -> 00:24:25.120] sometimes they're a thousand to 4,000
- [00:24:23.039 -> 00:24:26.880] words effectively what I've done is I go
- [00:24:25.120 -> 00:24:29.240] through and I read a whole bunch of
- [00:24:26.880 -> 00:24:31.240] sources like books art articles I watch
- [00:24:29.240 -> 00:24:33.120] YouTube videos and I distill all of my
- [00:24:31.240 -> 00:24:35.399] thoughts into atoms of the specific
- [00:24:33.120 -> 00:24:36.919] Concepts then I take my own ideas and
- [00:24:35.399 -> 00:24:39.120] insights that I derive from multiple
- [00:24:36.919 -> 00:24:41.480] atoms in my own projects and I start to
- [00:24:39.120 -> 00:24:43.240] link together the molecules and come up
- [00:24:41.480 -> 00:24:44.960] with a list of ideas that I would like
- [00:24:43.240 -> 00:24:47.640] to talk about and then I take that list
- [00:24:44.960 -> 00:24:49.919] of ideas and I put it into this template
- [00:24:47.640 -> 00:24:51.559] for my newsletter so for example I might
- [00:24:49.919 -> 00:24:53.799] go through and come up with a list of
- [00:24:51.559 -> 00:24:56.120] three different problems that I've got
- [00:24:53.799 -> 00:24:57.360] from literature three atoms related to
- [00:24:56.120 -> 00:25:00.159] something to do with artificial
- [00:24:57.360 -> 00:25:02.039] intelligence or intellectual property or
- [00:25:00.159 -> 00:25:03.679] something to do with photography and
- [00:25:02.039 -> 00:25:05.679] I'll come up with three different
- [00:25:03.679 -> 00:25:08.440] problems that are related to atoms that
- [00:25:05.679 -> 00:25:10.520] I've derived and molecules that I have
- [00:25:08.440 -> 00:25:12.559] used to solve those problems so then
- [00:25:10.520 -> 00:25:13.799] I'll put it together in a story format
- [00:25:12.559 -> 00:25:16.279] that I can then share with people as a
- [00:25:13.799 -> 00:25:18.120] newsletter or add to my digital Garden
- [00:25:16.279 -> 00:25:20.559] as part of my cultivating segment of my
- [00:25:18.120 -> 00:25:22.520] newsletter so the goal here is that
- [00:25:20.559 -> 00:25:25.240] whatever your project is whatever your
- [00:25:22.520 -> 00:25:26.679] desired form of expression something
- [00:25:25.240 -> 00:25:28.000] that you can share your work with other
- [00:25:26.679 -> 00:25:30.240] people that's where you're trying to
- [00:25:28.000 -> 00:25:32.200] create a sequence of notes that are
- [00:25:30.240 -> 00:25:33.960] within your permanent notes so for
- [00:25:32.200 -> 00:25:36.200] example you may take five or six
- [00:25:33.960 -> 00:25:38.240] molecules and thread them together into
- [00:25:36.200 -> 00:25:39.679] a note sequence and that's how you can
- [00:25:38.240 -> 00:25:41.320] publish it you might not even have to
- [00:25:39.679 -> 00:25:43.559] change anything about the molecule
- [00:25:41.320 -> 00:25:46.559] itself because you've already written
- [00:25:43.559 -> 00:25:48.559] the molecule in a format that it's able
- [00:25:46.559 -> 00:25:50.720] to be expressed and what you might do is
- [00:25:48.559 -> 00:25:52.440] you might take three or four molecules
- [00:25:50.720 -> 00:25:53.919] and then put them in order in a way that
- [00:25:52.440 -> 00:25:55.600] makes sense for how you would like to
- [00:25:53.919 -> 00:25:57.039] express it as your newsletter and then
- [00:25:55.600 -> 00:25:59.039] you realize that there's a gap there's
- [00:25:57.039 -> 00:26:00.679] something missing between the molecules
- [00:25:59.039 -> 00:26:02.600] well that you can just fill in as part
- [00:26:00.679 -> 00:26:04.159] of the alloy to make it in a publishable
- [00:26:02.600 -> 00:26:05.960] format related to that let's create
- [00:26:04.159 -> 00:26:07.760] another example of an atom from how to
- [00:26:05.960 -> 00:26:10.520] take smart notes so I can go and create
- [00:26:07.760 -> 00:26:12.360] a new note insert template of adom Copy
- [00:26:10.520 -> 00:26:14.000] in the quote which again is from how to
- [00:26:12.360 -> 00:26:16.360] take smart notes write down the page
- [00:26:14.000 -> 00:26:18.200] number link to the source the quote here
- [00:26:16.360 -> 00:26:20.080] is there's no need to start from scratch
- [00:26:18.200 -> 00:26:22.120] keep doing what you would do anyway read
- [00:26:20.080 -> 00:26:25.520] think write just take smart notes along
- [00:26:22.120 -> 00:26:29.279] the way so maybe my Atomic note here is
- [00:26:25.520 -> 00:26:31.080] smart notes enable me to do what I'm
- [00:26:29.279 -> 00:26:32.640] already doing so now if I wanted to take
- [00:26:31.080 -> 00:26:33.880] this Atomic note and Link it to a
- [00:26:32.640 -> 00:26:35.600] concept that I had already thought of
- [00:26:33.880 -> 00:26:37.960] earlier which was the analogy for a Lego
- [00:26:35.600 -> 00:26:40.679] brick I could make a new note and apply
- [00:26:37.960 -> 00:26:43.520] the molecule
- [00:26:40.679 -> 00:26:45.640] template so I can take this concept this
- [00:26:43.520 -> 00:26:47.279] singular quote from this atom I can
- [00:26:45.640 -> 00:26:49.640] reframe it to Smart notes are like Lego
- [00:26:47.279 -> 00:26:51.039] bricks they enable me to create a system
- [00:26:49.640 -> 00:26:52.640] of interoperable blocks that can be
- [00:26:51.039 -> 00:26:54.720] sequenced together in an indefinite
- [00:26:52.640 -> 00:26:56.440] number of combinations by taking smart
- [00:26:54.720 -> 00:26:58.240] notes I can do what I'm already doing
- [00:26:56.440 -> 00:27:00.159] read think right so this was taking my
- [00:26:58.240 -> 00:27:02.159] my analogy and applying it to the
- [00:27:00.159 -> 00:27:04.960] concept that I extracted from the book
- [00:27:02.159 -> 00:27:06.840] how to take smart notes on page 146 so I
- [00:27:04.960 -> 00:27:08.480] can always go back and find the direct
- [00:27:06.840 -> 00:27:10.679] train of thought that led me to that
- [00:27:08.480 -> 00:27:13.399] idea so now that I have that molecule I
- [00:27:10.679 -> 00:27:15.320] can move the file to the molecule folder
- [00:27:13.399 -> 00:27:17.200] I can search for all of my existing
- [00:27:15.320 -> 00:27:18.960] molecules and I could go take a look at
- [00:27:17.200 -> 00:27:21.200] the molecule folder and I would be able
- [00:27:18.960 -> 00:27:22.960] to go work through all of my existing
- [00:27:21.200 -> 00:27:24.240] thoughts and ideas that I've already
- [00:27:22.960 -> 00:27:26.039] connected and try to make more
- [00:27:24.240 -> 00:27:27.880] connections between them so if I look at
- [00:27:26.039 -> 00:27:30.080] it in the graph view I could filter
- [00:27:27.880 -> 00:27:31.559] specific specifically by hasht molecule
- [00:27:30.080 -> 00:27:33.360] and obviously I only have a couple notes
- [00:27:31.559 -> 00:27:35.520] with that tag at the moment but I'd be
- [00:27:33.360 -> 00:27:37.919] able to quickly see any particular
- [00:27:35.520 -> 00:27:39.720] patterns in My Graph here by going
- [00:27:37.919 -> 00:27:41.440] through and identifying how the
- [00:27:39.720 -> 00:27:43.120] different notes relate to one another I
- [00:27:41.440 -> 00:27:44.600] can start to identify clusters of
- [00:27:43.120 -> 00:27:45.799] knowledge based on the questions that
- [00:27:44.600 -> 00:27:47.720] I've been asking that are the most
- [00:27:45.799 -> 00:27:49.480] important to me to help explain that
- [00:27:47.720 -> 00:27:51.159] concept let's take a look at my current
- [00:27:49.480 -> 00:27:52.799] brain so this is my main obsidian fault
- [00:27:51.159 -> 00:27:55.880] that has a ton of notes in it so if I
- [00:27:52.799 -> 00:27:57.840] wanted to I could limit by molecule and
- [00:27:55.880 -> 00:27:59.679] I could find all of the specific notes
- [00:27:57.840 -> 00:28:01.919] in here so you can start to see oh
- [00:27:59.679 -> 00:28:03.840] here's a particular cluster here's a
- [00:28:01.919 -> 00:28:05.279] cluster here's a cluster all of these
- [00:28:03.840 -> 00:28:06.960] notes have different relationships to
- [00:28:05.279 -> 00:28:08.519] one another and the more connections I
- [00:28:06.960 -> 00:28:10.679] pull them together the more you can
- [00:28:08.519 -> 00:28:13.080] begin to start to see how the different
- [00:28:10.679 -> 00:28:15.080] notes relate to one another patterns
- [00:28:13.080 -> 00:28:16.559] begin to emerge over time and if I
- [00:28:15.080 -> 00:28:18.399] wanted to rather than going to the
- [00:28:16.559 -> 00:28:20.480] internet to look for more information I
- [00:28:18.399 -> 00:28:22.480] could just come into this system and
- [00:28:20.480 -> 00:28:24.000] look at my existing information which is
- [00:28:22.480 -> 00:28:25.440] going to be a lot more sustainable for
- [00:28:24.000 -> 00:28:27.039] me to deal with now that I've gone
- [00:28:25.440 -> 00:28:29.640] through and templated this entire system
- [00:28:27.039 -> 00:28:31.600] of molecular that'll C I thought that it
- [00:28:29.640 -> 00:28:33.640] might be helpful for me to go through a
- [00:28:31.600 -> 00:28:35.720] few more examples of creating atoms
- [00:28:33.640 -> 00:28:37.120] using those atoms to create molecules
- [00:28:35.720 -> 00:28:38.919] and then using those molecules to
- [00:28:37.120 -> 00:28:40.600] quickly outline an alloy like a
- [00:28:38.919 -> 00:28:42.080] newsletter or an article I'm just
- [00:28:40.600 -> 00:28:43.679] quickly going to create a couple more
- [00:28:42.080 -> 00:28:45.679] atoms using some of my favorite
- [00:28:43.679 -> 00:28:48.279] principles that I've learned in the past
- [00:28:45.679 -> 00:28:50.760] and then I'll apply those in a way that
- [00:28:48.279 -> 00:28:53.760] demonstrates how molecular zcas can be
- [00:28:50.760 -> 00:28:55.320] so effective for reusing Concepts in new
- [00:28:53.760 -> 00:28:57.240] ways the first concept I want to talk
- [00:28:55.320 -> 00:28:59.279] about is called the PTO principle which
- [00:28:57.240 -> 00:29:01.640] is uh singular concept so I'm going to
- [00:28:59.279 -> 00:29:03.120] insert the atom template my favorite use
- [00:29:01.640 -> 00:29:04.840] of this principle comes from the book
- [00:29:03.120 -> 00:29:06.600] The one thing which I have listed in my
- [00:29:04.840 -> 00:29:08.919] recommended reading on my website the
- [00:29:06.600 -> 00:29:10.799] one thing is effectively trying to help
- [00:29:08.919 -> 00:29:13.159] people with decision fatigue and
- [00:29:10.799 -> 00:29:15.440] overthinking which are two of my biggest
- [00:29:13.159 -> 00:29:17.760] blocks that I find myself having when
- [00:29:15.440 -> 00:29:19.760] creating new works and working with
- [00:29:17.760 -> 00:29:22.000] knowledge or creativity generally so I
- [00:29:19.760 -> 00:29:24.000] found the one thing very helpful and one
- [00:29:22.000 -> 00:29:25.679] of the key takeaways is the one thing is
- [00:29:24.000 -> 00:29:27.880] that you can keep applying the Proto
- [00:29:25.679 -> 00:29:29.519] principle to reduce the complexity of
- [00:29:27.880 -> 00:29:31.640] the problem that you're dealing with the
- [00:29:29.519 -> 00:29:34.279] prto principle is effectively that 80%
- [00:29:31.640 -> 00:29:37.080] of outputs come from 20% of inputs it's
- [00:29:34.279 -> 00:29:39.279] the theory of unequal distribution this
- [00:29:37.080 -> 00:29:41.600] quote came from chapter 4 and the topic
- [00:29:39.279 -> 00:29:44.159] relates to productivity and I would also
- [00:29:41.600 -> 00:29:46.080] say to something called a power law so I
- [00:29:44.159 -> 00:29:47.720] could give this an alias because this
- [00:29:46.080 -> 00:29:49.480] principle is often known as the 8020
- [00:29:47.720 -> 00:29:51.559] Rule and that would be it for the atom
- [00:29:49.480 -> 00:29:53.840] this is just a quick explanation of a
- [00:29:51.559 -> 00:29:55.480] singular concept that reminds me of what
- [00:29:53.840 -> 00:29:57.679] this principle is all about so let's
- [00:29:55.480 -> 00:30:00.000] create a new note and I'll add the PTO
- [00:29:57.679 -> 00:30:02.000] principle as the beginning of an alloy
- [00:30:00.000 -> 00:30:03.880] but the key here that's not listed in
- [00:30:02.000 -> 00:30:06.240] the principle itself is that in order
- [00:30:03.880 -> 00:30:08.039] for there to be 80% of outputs there
- [00:30:06.240 -> 00:30:09.559] needs to be some kind of input so in
- [00:30:08.039 -> 00:30:10.880] order for me to apply the Proto
- [00:30:09.559 -> 00:30:12.320] principle there needs to be some kind of
- [00:30:10.880 -> 00:30:14.279] data and this brings in another one of
- [00:30:12.320 -> 00:30:16.159] my favorite Concepts the concept of 1%
- [00:30:14.279 -> 00:30:18.440] better every day this concept comes from
- [00:30:16.159 -> 00:30:19.840] the book Atomic Habits by James clear
- [00:30:18.440 -> 00:30:22.320] and he refers to this as continuous
- [00:30:19.840 -> 00:30:25.399] Improvement and the concept is that if
- [00:30:22.320 -> 00:30:27.360] you operate in a way that you can get 1%
- [00:30:25.399 -> 00:30:29.840] better every day at something that
- [00:30:27.360 -> 00:30:32.880] compounds over time it's the power of
- [00:30:29.840 -> 00:30:34.559] tiny gains so that you would be 38 times
- [00:30:32.880 -> 00:30:36.919] better at whatever that thing is than
- [00:30:34.559 -> 00:30:38.760] you would be if you had done nothing or
- [00:30:36.919 -> 00:30:41.480] in contrast if you got 1% worse every
- [00:30:38.760 -> 00:30:43.200] day you'd be at effectively 3% of what
- [00:30:41.480 -> 00:30:44.640] you were at when you started let's add
- [00:30:43.200 -> 00:30:45.720] this principle in but I could do too is
- [00:30:44.640 -> 00:30:47.200] instead of just including the reference
- [00:30:45.720 -> 00:30:49.880] link to the book Atomic habits I could
- [00:30:47.200 -> 00:30:52.120] also include the URL of James clear's
- [00:30:49.880 -> 00:30:53.840] website which I could add as its own
- [00:30:52.120 -> 00:30:55.320] separate note if I wanted to but because
- [00:30:53.840 -> 00:30:57.120] this is just a specific reference I'll
- [00:30:55.320 -> 00:30:59.399] just add it in as a reference link and
- [00:30:57.120 -> 00:31:01.440] then let's give it the top IC of
- [00:30:59.399 -> 00:31:03.200] productivity and also power laws so you
- [00:31:01.440 -> 00:31:05.639] can see why these two concepts the parto
- [00:31:03.200 -> 00:31:07.519] principle and 1% better every day are
- [00:31:05.639 -> 00:31:09.440] both related and I can already start to
- [00:31:07.519 -> 00:31:11.279] see this has to do with a compounding
- [00:31:09.440 -> 00:31:12.880] effect so now to tie this into what
- [00:31:11.279 -> 00:31:14.600] we've been talking about already let's
- [00:31:12.880 -> 00:31:16.039] add a note for the generation effect so
- [00:31:14.600 -> 00:31:18.000] the generation effect relates to the
- [00:31:16.039 -> 00:31:20.120] topic of note taking and I would say to
- [00:31:18.000 -> 00:31:21.760] a second brain and also productivity the
- [00:31:20.120 -> 00:31:24.080] generation effect is translating
- [00:31:21.760 -> 00:31:25.399] Concepts into my own words improves
- [00:31:24.080 -> 00:31:26.960] understanding and knowledge retention
- [00:31:25.399 -> 00:31:28.919] effectively generating Knowledge from
- [00:31:26.960 -> 00:31:30.200] information at it is translated in a way
- [00:31:28.919 -> 00:31:31.679] that makes the most sense to me my
- [00:31:30.200 -> 00:31:34.279] favorite source of this concept comes
- [00:31:31.679 -> 00:31:35.519] from Nest Labs by Ann lur lump this is
- [00:31:34.279 -> 00:31:37.320] where I first learned of the generation
- [00:31:35.519 -> 00:31:38.639] effect she has a nice graphic here where
- [00:31:37.320 -> 00:31:40.480] you can see that going back and forth
- [00:31:38.639 -> 00:31:42.639] between studying and creating you
- [00:31:40.480 -> 00:31:44.440] improve the retrieval of information
- [00:31:42.639 -> 00:31:46.159] when it's needed over time and she also
- [00:31:44.440 -> 00:31:47.679] includes the original research paper
- [00:31:46.159 -> 00:31:49.399] that she learned about it the Journal of
- [00:31:47.679 -> 00:31:51.519] verbal learning and verbal behavior from
- [00:31:49.399 -> 00:31:53.200] 1978 where information is better
- [00:31:51.519 -> 00:31:54.840] remembered if it is actively created
- [00:31:53.200 -> 00:31:56.720] from one's own mind rather than simply
- [00:31:54.840 -> 00:31:58.600] read in a passive way since this is my
- [00:31:56.720 -> 00:32:00.519] favorite source for this information I
- [00:31:58.600 -> 00:32:03.039] will copy
- [00:32:00.519 -> 00:32:04.480] that and add it as a reference link and
- [00:32:03.039 -> 00:32:06.960] this is where I could for example
- [00:32:04.480 -> 00:32:08.880] introduce a new source called nest laabs
- [00:32:06.960 -> 00:32:10.679] because Nest laabs has more than one
- [00:32:08.880 -> 00:32:12.960] specific reference and I'll also include
- [00:32:10.679 -> 00:32:14.840] the link here but I'll open up nest
- [00:32:12.960 -> 00:32:16.880] laabs and I'll turn this into a source
- [00:32:14.840 -> 00:32:18.120] template and add the main website and
- [00:32:16.880 -> 00:32:19.559] I'm not going to add more for the moment
- [00:32:18.120 -> 00:32:20.919] but at least I now have a source that I
- [00:32:19.559 -> 00:32:22.279] can go back to and add more information
- [00:32:20.919 -> 00:32:23.960] if I need to okay so you might be
- [00:32:22.279 -> 00:32:25.360] wondering how do these Concepts all tie
- [00:32:23.960 -> 00:32:28.279] together well effectively what I've done
- [00:32:25.360 -> 00:32:31.080] so far is I've created singular Atomic
- [00:32:28.279 -> 00:32:32.880] concepts for a few different effects and
- [00:32:31.080 -> 00:32:34.639] now it's time to start converting these
- [00:32:32.880 -> 00:32:35.919] into molecules so let's create a new
- [00:32:34.639 -> 00:32:38.200] note the thought that I have here for
- [00:32:35.919 -> 00:32:40.080] the molecule is that ZL Casten compounds
- [00:32:38.200 -> 00:32:41.600] over time so if we take a look you can
- [00:32:40.080 -> 00:32:43.360] delete this if you want to so the
- [00:32:41.600 -> 00:32:44.880] thought here that the idea that came to
- [00:32:43.360 -> 00:32:46.679] mind is that the more permanent nodes I
- [00:32:44.880 -> 00:32:49.399] create the greater likelihood there is
- [00:32:46.679 -> 00:32:51.240] for emergence some unpredictable
- [00:32:49.399 -> 00:32:53.360] property by writing every day taking
- [00:32:51.240 -> 00:32:55.559] time to distill information translating
- [00:32:53.360 -> 00:32:57.600] it into my own words with the generation
- [00:32:55.559 -> 00:32:59.840] effect I can get 1% better every day at
- [00:32:57.600 -> 00:33:01.600] using using SLE Casten at generating
- [00:32:59.840 -> 00:33:03.919] knowledge within my second brain so this
- [00:33:01.600 -> 00:33:05.559] applies to the topic of not taking
- [00:33:03.919 -> 00:33:07.240] second brain and personal Knowledge
- [00:33:05.559 -> 00:33:09.279] Management System but how does the PTO
- [00:33:07.240 -> 00:33:11.399] principle fit into this well if we take
- [00:33:09.279 -> 00:33:13.240] a look now at the graph view you see
- [00:33:11.399 -> 00:33:15.000] that our graph is getting a little bit
- [00:33:13.240 -> 00:33:16.880] bigger and I color code the difference
- [00:33:15.000 -> 00:33:19.480] between the atom and the molecules I can
- [00:33:16.880 -> 00:33:21.600] start to see which notes form which part
- [00:33:19.480 -> 00:33:23.519] of my second brain which fall under
- [00:33:21.600 -> 00:33:24.799] atoms and which fall under molecules but
- [00:33:23.519 -> 00:33:26.919] as you can imagine this starts to get
- [00:33:24.799 -> 00:33:29.200] much more complicated over time so what
- [00:33:26.919 -> 00:33:32.120] would be useful would be to have a way
- [00:33:29.200 -> 00:33:33.440] to process this information and identify
- [00:33:32.120 -> 00:33:36.000] the notes that have become the most
- [00:33:33.440 -> 00:33:38.600] important to me because for example if I
- [00:33:36.000 -> 00:33:41.480] wrote one note a day for the next 365
- [00:33:38.600 -> 00:33:43.120] days to get 1% better every day and 38
- [00:33:41.480 -> 00:33:45.399] times better than last year that's going
- [00:33:43.120 -> 00:33:47.799] to give me 365 notes which is a lot of
- [00:33:45.399 -> 00:33:50.480] notes to filter through so this is where
- [00:33:47.799 -> 00:33:52.639] I could have another molecule idea I'll
- [00:33:50.480 -> 00:33:54.840] just delete this for simplification and
- [00:33:52.639 -> 00:33:56.639] the thought here is that AI augments
- [00:33:54.840 -> 00:33:58.320] data sets and reduces decision fatigue
- [00:33:56.639 -> 00:34:00.159] if I go through and create notes every
- [00:33:58.320 -> 00:34:02.279] day using the generation effect to
- [00:34:00.159 -> 00:34:04.639] generate emergence to compound it with
- [00:34:02.279 -> 00:34:07.320] the 1% better everyday principle and
- [00:34:04.639 -> 00:34:09.679] then I use AI to apply the PTO principle
- [00:34:07.320 -> 00:34:11.599] to the notes to identify which notes
- [00:34:09.679 -> 00:34:13.520] have the most impact I can now begin to
- [00:34:11.599 -> 00:34:15.040] augment my existing data set or my
- [00:34:13.520 -> 00:34:16.879] knowledge base using artificial
- [00:34:15.040 -> 00:34:18.879] intelligence and my understanding of the
- [00:34:16.879 -> 00:34:21.560] pareda principle so this is where we now
- [00:34:18.879 -> 00:34:23.440] start to get into the alloy creation and
- [00:34:21.560 -> 00:34:25.280] I am able to start threading these
- [00:34:23.440 -> 00:34:26.879] Concepts together so if you remember I
- [00:34:25.280 -> 00:34:28.359] like to start off my Alloys with some
- [00:34:26.879 -> 00:34:30.399] kind of problem so so effectively what
- [00:34:28.359 -> 00:34:31.760] I'm doing here if I combine artificial
- [00:34:30.399 -> 00:34:33.679] intelligence with my personal Knowledge
- [00:34:31.760 -> 00:34:35.879] Management System to augment it to
- [00:34:33.679 -> 00:34:37.200] augment my second brain I can use it to
- [00:34:35.879 -> 00:34:39.119] identify the knowledge that has the
- [00:34:37.200 -> 00:34:41.000] greatest impact on me or in other words
- [00:34:39.119 -> 00:34:44.000] apply the PTO principle to identify what
- [00:34:41.000 -> 00:34:45.960] 20% of notes leads to 80% of results
- [00:34:44.000 -> 00:34:48.000] after I've been using the generation
- [00:34:45.960 -> 00:34:50.040] effect to get 1% better every day at
- [00:34:48.000 -> 00:34:51.560] building my system so effectively I am
- [00:34:50.040 -> 00:34:53.599] threading two different molecules
- [00:34:51.560 -> 00:34:55.720] together zle cast in compounds over time
- [00:34:53.599 -> 00:34:58.480] and AI augments data sets and reduces
- [00:34:55.720 -> 00:35:00.839] decision fatigue if I wanted I can embed
- [00:34:58.480 -> 00:35:02.440] these notes directly so I can go and
- [00:35:00.839 -> 00:35:04.359] just add an exclamation mark in front of
- [00:35:02.440 -> 00:35:06.400] the note and that automatically pulls
- [00:35:04.359 -> 00:35:09.720] the notes in and I can do the same thing
- [00:35:06.400 -> 00:35:09.720] with the atomic Notes
- [00:35:10.680 -> 00:35:14.800] too I'll rename this to AI augmented
- [00:35:13.520 -> 00:35:16.599] personal Knowledge Management to
- [00:35:14.800 -> 00:35:18.800] overcome overthinking so effectively
- [00:35:16.599 -> 00:35:20.520] what I did I identified three concepts
- [00:35:18.800 -> 00:35:22.680] from various books and articles that
- [00:35:20.520 -> 00:35:25.079] I've read that have personally helped me
- [00:35:22.680 -> 00:35:26.760] to understand my own knowledge and how I
- [00:35:25.079 -> 00:35:28.480] can solve problems and make decisions
- [00:35:26.760 -> 00:35:29.640] better while proving my own
- [00:35:28.480 -> 00:35:31.400] understanding of the decisions that I'm
- [00:35:29.640 -> 00:35:33.400] making as I'm building out the knowledge
- [00:35:31.400 -> 00:35:34.839] and I can use those Concepts along with
- [00:35:33.400 -> 00:35:36.839] the zcas and system which I've been
- [00:35:34.839 -> 00:35:38.599] working on here to combine that with
- [00:35:36.839 -> 00:35:40.800] artificial intelligence to help reduce
- [00:35:38.599 -> 00:35:42.480] decision fatigue and overthinking so now
- [00:35:40.800 -> 00:35:44.640] all I really have to do is I could go
- [00:35:42.480 -> 00:35:46.480] and fill in the gaps between these
- [00:35:44.640 -> 00:35:48.400] different concepts and explain it a
- [00:35:46.480 -> 00:35:50.119] little bit more in depth and I've
- [00:35:48.400 -> 00:35:51.880] effectively created a newsletter on some
- [00:35:50.119 -> 00:35:53.079] of my favorite Concepts that lead to
- [00:35:51.880 -> 00:35:55.040] something that helps me with my own
- [00:35:53.079 -> 00:35:57.160] mental health over time as a practical
- [00:35:55.040 -> 00:35:59.200] example of me actually implementing this
- [00:35:57.160 -> 00:36:01.599] idea that I had this article that I put
- [00:35:59.200 -> 00:36:02.720] together this alloy or publish note
- [00:36:01.599 -> 00:36:04.240] something that would end up going in my
- [00:36:02.720 -> 00:36:06.119] newsletter or perhaps be turned into a
- [00:36:04.240 -> 00:36:09.240] YouTube video I've been using Google's
- [00:36:06.119 -> 00:36:11.119] notebook LM to help me create these
- [00:36:09.240 -> 00:36:13.319] Concepts and work with a large amount of
- [00:36:11.119 -> 00:36:14.920] information and help reduce my decision
- [00:36:13.319 -> 00:36:17.480] fatigue so I've been actually using
- [00:36:14.920 -> 00:36:19.440] notebook LM to apply the prto principle
- [00:36:17.480 -> 00:36:21.400] to help me make connections between my
- [00:36:19.440 -> 00:36:22.720] existing notes that I've published for
- [00:36:21.400 -> 00:36:25.280] example you can see on the side here
- [00:36:22.720 -> 00:36:27.319] that I've uploaded sources all of these
- [00:36:25.280 -> 00:36:28.880] numbered sources are my newsletters that
- [00:36:27.319 -> 00:36:31.160] I've published over the last year and a
- [00:36:28.880 -> 00:36:34.400] bit so what I could do for example is I
- [00:36:31.160 -> 00:36:37.240] could prompt notebook LM and ask it to
- [00:36:34.400 -> 00:36:39.720] identify themes using the PTO principle
- [00:36:37.240 -> 00:36:41.760] to see which Concepts seem to have had
- [00:36:39.720 -> 00:36:43.680] the largest impact on me over the last
- [00:36:41.760 -> 00:36:45.520] year so let's quickly try that apply the
- [00:36:43.680 -> 00:36:47.920] PTO principle to my numbered sources
- [00:36:45.520 -> 00:36:49.040] which are my newsletters to identify 20%
- [00:36:47.920 -> 00:36:50.480] of the topics that have led to the
- [00:36:49.040 -> 00:36:52.040] largest amount of impactful writing
- [00:36:50.480 -> 00:36:53.599] summarize these Concepts in the form of
- [00:36:52.040 -> 00:36:54.520] atoms so this already knows what atoms
- [00:36:53.599 -> 00:36:56.000] are because I've been having
- [00:36:54.520 -> 00:36:58.280] conversations and saving notes
- [00:36:56.000 -> 00:36:59.680] explaining my molecular zcast system so
- [00:36:58.280 -> 00:37:01.640] notebook LM did a prettyy good job
- [00:36:59.680 -> 00:37:03.200] summarizing the key atems with Noe
- [00:37:01.640 -> 00:37:05.079] taking systems personal Knowledge
- [00:37:03.200 -> 00:37:06.880] Management digital Gardens and content
- [00:37:05.079 -> 00:37:09.200] creation I would say that these are the
- [00:37:06.880 -> 00:37:10.280] main Concepts through my newsletters and
- [00:37:09.200 -> 00:37:11.880] this is what you've been seeing in my
- [00:37:10.280 -> 00:37:14.079] YouTube videos because I use the
- [00:37:11.880 -> 00:37:15.440] newsletters to create a knowledge base
- [00:37:14.079 -> 00:37:17.599] that I've been drawing on to make these
- [00:37:15.440 -> 00:37:19.480] YouTube videos so I would say that this
- [00:37:17.599 -> 00:37:21.960] checks out quite well with applying the
- [00:37:19.480 -> 00:37:23.720] prto principle using notebook LM to my
- [00:37:21.960 -> 00:37:25.119] existing notes this is a really easy way
- [00:37:23.720 -> 00:37:26.599] to augment my personal knowledge
- [00:37:25.119 -> 00:37:28.880] management system using artificial
- [00:37:26.599 -> 00:37:30.520] intelligence without giving my
- [00:37:28.880 -> 00:37:31.400] information and data away for training
- [00:37:30.520 -> 00:37:33.720] if you're interested in learning how
- [00:37:31.400 -> 00:37:35.599] notebook LM works with obsidian because
- [00:37:33.720 -> 00:37:38.280] you can add sources that include
- [00:37:35.599 -> 00:37:40.040] markdown files which obsidian runs on I
- [00:37:38.280 -> 00:37:42.160] have another video that goes in depth on
- [00:37:40.040 -> 00:37:43.480] how you can use notebook LM to augment
- [00:37:42.160 -> 00:37:45.280] your personal Knowledge Management
- [00:37:43.480 -> 00:37:46.920] System and hopefully help you with
- [00:37:45.280 -> 00:37:48.800] overthinking and decision fatigue so I
- [00:37:46.920 -> 00:37:50.640] hope that this gives you a good idea on
- [00:37:48.800 -> 00:37:52.400] how you can have a workflow that goes
- [00:37:50.640 -> 00:37:53.880] from Concepts that would start
- [00:37:52.400 -> 00:37:56.000] originally as a fleeting note some
- [00:37:53.880 -> 00:37:58.040] Epiphany that I may have had tied
- [00:37:56.000 -> 00:38:00.040] together with Concepts that learned from
- [00:37:58.040 -> 00:38:02.240] books or reading articles or watching
- [00:38:00.040 -> 00:38:04.240] YouTube videos like the PTO principle or
- [00:38:02.240 -> 00:38:06.359] the generation effect and how I can take
- [00:38:04.240 -> 00:38:08.319] those Concepts and those insights and
- [00:38:06.359 -> 00:38:10.920] thread them into molecules make
- [00:38:08.319 -> 00:38:13.319] connections between the atoms and then
- [00:38:10.920 -> 00:38:15.839] take those atoms and those molecules and
- [00:38:13.319 -> 00:38:18.079] literally just Nest them in a new note
- [00:38:15.839 -> 00:38:19.520] by using the embed function in obsidian
- [00:38:18.079 -> 00:38:21.480] and then I can go through and fill in
- [00:38:19.520 -> 00:38:22.560] the gaps to create a published work I
- [00:38:21.480 -> 00:38:25.160] could then go publish this into my
- [00:38:22.560 -> 00:38:27.520] digital Garden which I have at w. XYZ
- [00:38:25.160 -> 00:38:29.520] you can see here I have Alloys atams and
- [00:38:27.520 -> 00:38:31.160] molecules digital Garden authors I have
- [00:38:29.520 -> 00:38:34.160] my Vault sorted in a way that allows me
- [00:38:31.160 -> 00:38:35.599] to publish directly to my digital garden
- [00:38:34.160 -> 00:38:37.000] and here's another example of original
- [00:38:35.599 -> 00:38:38.480] thinking which I talked about in the
- [00:38:37.000 -> 00:38:40.079] last YouTube video on the theory of
- [00:38:38.480 -> 00:38:41.920] knowledge where I walked through Bloom's
- [00:38:40.079 -> 00:38:43.760] taxonomy and a couple other Knowledge
- [00:38:41.920 -> 00:38:46.119] Management theories so this is another
- [00:38:43.760 -> 00:38:48.800] example of an alloy that started with an
- [00:38:46.119 -> 00:38:50.680] atom of the concept of Bloom's taxonomy
- [00:38:48.800 -> 00:38:52.160] and then I applied my own understanding
- [00:38:50.680 -> 00:38:54.240] and knowledge from being an intellectual
- [00:38:52.160 -> 00:38:55.560] property lawyer and a patent agent and
- [00:38:54.240 -> 00:38:57.720] understanding what it means to generate
- [00:38:55.560 -> 00:39:00.280] original value in an intellect ual
- [00:38:57.720 -> 00:39:04.319] property standpoint and then use that to
- [00:39:00.280 -> 00:39:05.440] express as an alloy to my digital Garden
- [00:39:04.319 -> 00:39:07.400] you've been able to see how I've
- [00:39:05.440 -> 00:39:09.720] converted the zetel Casten system into
- [00:39:07.400 -> 00:39:11.520] my molecular note system in a way that
- [00:39:09.720 -> 00:39:13.680] takes advantage of the digital ecosystem
- [00:39:11.520 -> 00:39:16.000] rather than the physical one of zedcast
- [00:39:13.680 -> 00:39:18.079] but maintains the same benefits of the
- [00:39:16.000 -> 00:39:19.640] zel Caston system again it's really hard
- [00:39:18.079 -> 00:39:21.200] to put into words how valuable this
- [00:39:19.640 -> 00:39:23.119] system can become over time it's
- [00:39:21.200 -> 00:39:25.240] something that you can only really learn
- [00:39:23.119 -> 00:39:27.640] by doing but if we go back to the data
- [00:39:25.240 -> 00:39:29.880] Insight wisdom graph you can see that
- [00:39:27.640 -> 00:39:31.079] wisdom really is action the only way
- [00:39:29.880 -> 00:39:32.839] that you're going to start to see this
- [00:39:31.079 -> 00:39:35.400] value is by making these connections
- [00:39:32.839 -> 00:39:37.880] yourself in a way that's intuitive to
- [00:39:35.400 -> 00:39:39.920] you I hope that this overview has shown
- [00:39:37.880 -> 00:39:42.200] you the value in using connected
- [00:39:39.920 -> 00:39:43.920] Thinking by leveling up Atomic notes
- [00:39:42.200 -> 00:39:45.960] through molecular notes combined with
- [00:39:43.920 -> 00:39:47.520] zetel Casten and the code method to
- [00:39:45.960 -> 00:39:49.599] really boost your personal Knowledge
- [00:39:47.520 -> 00:39:51.599] Management System and reduce information
- [00:39:49.599 -> 00:39:53.599] overload in your life zetel Casten was
- [00:39:51.599 -> 00:39:55.720] an incredibly confusing system for me at
- [00:39:53.599 -> 00:39:57.520] first but once I modified it into the
- [00:39:55.720 -> 00:39:59.720] molecular zle Casten system and
- [00:39:57.520 -> 00:40:01.920] templated it in obsidian I've have a
- [00:39:59.720 -> 00:40:04.599] much better grasp on how I can actually
- [00:40:01.920 -> 00:40:06.960] practically use this in my life I use my
- [00:40:04.599 -> 00:40:08.920] molecular zcast and system in obsidian
- [00:40:06.960 -> 00:40:10.560] every day every time I consume
- [00:40:08.920 -> 00:40:12.280] information and I find that there's
- [00:40:10.560 -> 00:40:14.240] something that resonates with me I jot
- [00:40:12.280 -> 00:40:15.720] it down as a fleeting note then I go
- [00:40:14.240 -> 00:40:17.800] back and I convert the fleeting notes
- [00:40:15.720 -> 00:40:20.040] into Atomic notes linking them to the
- [00:40:17.800 -> 00:40:22.440] original source and then go through and
- [00:40:20.040 -> 00:40:24.680] tie those atomic notes to my own ideas
- [00:40:22.440 -> 00:40:26.400] to form molecules it's really the best
- [00:40:24.680 -> 00:40:28.760] way that I've ever found to reduce the
- [00:40:26.400 -> 00:40:30.400] information overload in a practical way
- [00:40:28.760 -> 00:40:32.160] so that I can leverage my knowledge to
- [00:40:30.400 -> 00:40:34.040] create new things rather than talking
- [00:40:32.160 -> 00:40:36.119] more about zle Casten here I made a
- [00:40:34.040 -> 00:40:37.599] separate video that goes in depth on how
- [00:40:36.119 -> 00:40:39.760] it works and how it aligns with
- [00:40:37.599 -> 00:40:41.560] Knowledge Management Theory I recommend
- [00:40:39.760 -> 00:40:43.680] checking out that video for more context
- [00:40:41.560 -> 00:40:45.319] and deeper commentary on the value of
- [00:40:43.680 -> 00:40:47.000] using a note-taking system like
- [00:40:45.319 -> 00:40:48.280] molecular zedal Casten if you're
- [00:40:47.000 -> 00:40:50.240] interested in learning more about
- [00:40:48.280 -> 00:40:51.680] obsidian digital Gardens and personal
- [00:40:50.240 -> 00:40:53.720] Knowledge Management and how it can be
- [00:40:51.680 -> 00:40:55.160] augmented with artificial intelligence I
- [00:40:53.720 -> 00:40:56.800] also have a playlist here that goes
- [00:40:55.160 -> 00:40:58.480] through all of these Topics in much more
- [00:40:56.800 -> 00:40:59.960] depth I recommend checking it out if
- [00:40:58.480 -> 00:41:02.040] you're looking to expand your system in
- [00:40:59.960 -> 00:41:03.599] a very practical and easy to understand
- [00:41:02.040 -> 00:41:05.280] way a reminder that if you're interested
- [00:41:03.599 -> 00:41:07.319] in the templates that I built and the
- [00:41:05.280 -> 00:41:09.599] structure in obsidian along with the
- [00:41:07.319 -> 00:41:11.560] canvas workflow I'm making the system
- [00:41:09.599 -> 00:41:13.480] available for my paid subscribers as
- [00:41:11.560 -> 00:41:16.040] part of my YouTube membership it's
- [00:41:13.480 -> 00:41:18.520] currently $2.99 a month Canadian which
- [00:41:16.040 -> 00:41:20.240] is roughly $2 us so if you found these
- [00:41:18.520 -> 00:41:21.680] videos helpful I would really appreciate
- [00:41:20.240 -> 00:41:23.119] if you would consider supporting me if
- [00:41:21.680 -> 00:41:24.920] you have any questions about how this
- [00:41:23.119 -> 00:41:26.000] system works or how it relates to the
- [00:41:24.920 -> 00:41:27.800] rest of the personal Knowledge
- [00:41:26.000 -> 00:41:29.480] Management and AI systems that I've been
- [00:41:27.800 -> 00:41:31.079] describing please feel free to leave a
- [00:41:29.480 -> 00:41:33.280] comment below and I'll go through and
- [00:41:31.079 -> 00:41:34.800] answer questions to help everyone
- [00:41:33.280 -> 00:41:36.359] understand how this system can benefit
- [00:41:34.800 -> 00:41:38.240] their lives if you found this video
- [00:41:36.359 -> 00:41:40.119] helpful or valuable I would love if you
- [00:41:38.240 -> 00:41:41.599] would please consider subscribing I'm
- [00:41:40.119 -> 00:41:43.520] trying to make YouTube my full-time
- [00:41:41.599 -> 00:41:45.880] career so any support you can give is
- [00:41:43.520 -> 00:41:47.000] very much appreciated similarly if you
- [00:41:45.880 -> 00:41:48.720] found this valuable and would like to
- [00:41:47.000 -> 00:41:50.400] share it with a friend word of mouth is
- [00:41:48.720 -> 00:41:52.560] by far the best way to help me grow on
- [00:41:50.400 -> 00:41:53.960] YouTube so I appreciate any way that you
- [00:41:52.560 -> 00:41:55.319] could share this thanks again for
- [00:41:53.960 -> 00:41:58.319] watching and I will see you in the next
- [00:41:55.319 -> 00:41:58.319] video
