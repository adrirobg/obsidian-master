- [00:00:00.080 -> 00:00:03.879] obsidian can be incredibly helpful for
- [00:00:01.800 -> 00:00:05.480] making new connections a major perk
- [00:00:03.879 -> 00:00:07.240] compared to the physical zel Casten
- [00:00:05.480 -> 00:00:09.080] system the main benefit is that you're
- [00:00:07.240 -> 00:00:11.320] standardizing a system of building
- [00:00:09.080 -> 00:00:13.799] blocks like Lego where you can reuse
- [00:00:11.320 -> 00:00:14.879] your notes in an infinite number of ways
- [00:00:13.799 -> 00:00:17.160] you don't have to think about the
- [00:00:14.879 -> 00:00:19.199] organization or structure which frees up
- [00:00:17.160 -> 00:00:21.480] your mind to focus on the ideas and
- [00:00:19.199 -> 00:00:23.439] learning the goal of zetel cassen is to
- [00:00:21.480 -> 00:00:25.800] keep track of where information came
- [00:00:23.439 -> 00:00:27.480] from and your own ideas so you can build
- [00:00:25.800 -> 00:00:29.640] on external information with your
- [00:00:27.480 -> 00:00:32.160] internal ideas I've personally used a
- [00:00:29.640 -> 00:00:34.640] mod version of zle Casten to publish
- [00:00:32.160 -> 00:00:37.120] over 150,000 words in the last year
- [00:00:34.640 -> 00:00:39.680] alone or approximately three non-fiction
- [00:00:37.120 -> 00:00:41.640] books worth it's been the best way by
- [00:00:39.680 -> 00:00:44.120] far that I've ever found to manage my
- [00:00:41.640 -> 00:00:46.199] knowledge hello my name is Callum also
- [00:00:44.120 -> 00:00:48.239] known as Wonder loots and welcome to
- [00:00:46.199 -> 00:00:50.680] today's video on zetel Casten and
- [00:00:48.239 -> 00:00:52.920] Knowledge Management Theory an overview
- [00:00:50.680 -> 00:00:55.480] of my molecular zetel Caston notetaking
- [00:00:52.920 -> 00:00:57.239] system in obsidian modern tools enable
- [00:00:55.480 -> 00:00:59.160] us to keep track of information and
- [00:00:57.239 -> 00:01:00.600] knowledge better than ever before which
- [00:00:59.160 -> 00:01:02.519] is very much need needed in the
- [00:01:00.600 -> 00:01:04.439] information overload society that we
- [00:01:02.519 -> 00:01:06.520] live in to use these modern tools to
- [00:01:04.439 -> 00:01:08.680] their full potential it helps to take a
- [00:01:06.520 -> 00:01:10.880] look at how we can update successful
- [00:01:08.680 -> 00:01:13.320] physical systems to the modern digital
- [00:01:10.880 -> 00:01:15.560] world we can customize a digital system
- [00:01:13.320 -> 00:01:17.240] so that it is unique to each of us so
- [00:01:15.560 -> 00:01:19.280] that we can learn and keep track of
- [00:01:17.240 -> 00:01:21.240] knowledge in the most natural way
- [00:01:19.280 -> 00:01:23.240] possible a personal Knowledge Management
- [00:01:21.240 -> 00:01:24.840] System one of the best known systems of
- [00:01:23.240 -> 00:01:27.119] Knowledge Management is the zettle
- [00:01:24.840 -> 00:01:29.640] Casten system developed by Nicholas
- [00:01:27.119 -> 00:01:32.159] Lumen one of the most prolific writers
- [00:01:29.640 -> 00:01:35.000] of all time publishing more than 70
- [00:01:32.159 -> 00:01:37.280] books and 400 academic papers Nicholas
- [00:01:35.000 -> 00:01:40.159] Lumen credits his publishing success
- [00:01:37.280 -> 00:01:42.320] solely to one invention the zetel Casten
- [00:01:40.159 -> 00:01:44.360] zetel Casten is a structured notetaking
- [00:01:42.320 -> 00:01:46.360] system where you can keep your external
- [00:01:44.360 -> 00:01:48.640] information separate from your internal
- [00:01:46.360 -> 00:01:52.200] knowledge the word zettle Casten comes
- [00:01:48.640 -> 00:01:54.960] from zettle or slip and Casten box in
- [00:01:52.200 -> 00:01:57.039] German a slip is like an index card a
- [00:01:54.960 -> 00:01:59.399] small structured piece of information
- [00:01:57.039 -> 00:02:00.399] that you can use to store your notes on
- [00:01:59.399 -> 00:02:02.520] and
- [00:02:00.399 -> 00:02:04.399] the box is a way to keep those index
- [00:02:02.520 -> 00:02:06.320] cards organized so that you can find
- [00:02:04.399 -> 00:02:07.880] them easily in the future to make
- [00:02:06.320 -> 00:02:10.319] connections between them to build out
- [00:02:07.880 -> 00:02:12.520] your ideas this framework produces an
- [00:02:10.319 -> 00:02:14.879] external scaffolding for your mind a
- [00:02:12.520 -> 00:02:16.920] second brain so you can focus more on
- [00:02:14.879 -> 00:02:19.120] the ideas and following insights and
- [00:02:16.920 -> 00:02:21.000] intuition rather than trying to think of
- [00:02:19.120 -> 00:02:23.879] where should I put my note and how can I
- [00:02:21.000 -> 00:02:25.560] find it again it really adds a lot of
- [00:02:23.879 -> 00:02:26.959] potential to Knowledge Management
- [00:02:25.560 -> 00:02:29.080] because you really don't have to think
- [00:02:26.959 -> 00:02:31.120] about the structure since you've preset
- [00:02:29.080 -> 00:02:33.879] the structure of front today I'm going
- [00:02:31.120 -> 00:02:36.120] to map Len's physical zle Casten system
- [00:02:33.879 -> 00:02:38.640] to my molecular zedal Casten system in
- [00:02:36.120 -> 00:02:40.159] the digital ecosystem of obsidian I'm
- [00:02:38.640 -> 00:02:41.959] going to try and do this as simply as
- [00:02:40.159 -> 00:02:44.159] possible as I know that zedal casting
- [00:02:41.959 -> 00:02:46.879] can be kind of a confusing concept and a
- [00:02:44.159 -> 00:02:48.239] lot of people tend to over complicated
- [00:02:46.879 -> 00:02:50.959] I'm going to do this by focusing on
- [00:02:48.239 -> 00:02:54.120] three main elements read or watch
- [00:02:50.959 -> 00:02:57.000] consume information think take notes and
- [00:02:54.120 -> 00:02:58.680] work with your notes and write publish
- [00:02:57.000 -> 00:03:00.400] information based on the knowledge that
- [00:02:58.680 -> 00:03:03.080] you're keeping track in inside of your
- [00:03:00.400 -> 00:03:05.040] zle Casten system in obsidian we consume
- [00:03:03.080 -> 00:03:07.560] more information in one day than a
- [00:03:05.040 -> 00:03:09.519] person in the 1500s did in their entire
- [00:03:07.560 -> 00:03:11.280] lifetime understanding how to work with
- [00:03:09.519 -> 00:03:13.080] your knowledge and work with information
- [00:03:11.280 -> 00:03:14.840] is more important than ever and that's
- [00:03:13.080 -> 00:03:16.599] what I'm aiming to do with today's video
- [00:03:14.840 -> 00:03:19.040] here's today's outline what is zel
- [00:03:16.599 -> 00:03:21.480] Casten notetaking an overview of how
- [00:03:19.040 -> 00:03:23.840] Nicholas Lumen built his physical system
- [00:03:21.480 -> 00:03:25.519] and then extracting the key insights so
- [00:03:23.840 -> 00:03:27.680] we can introduce them into a digital
- [00:03:25.519 -> 00:03:29.560] system the goals of zle Casen and
- [00:03:27.680 -> 00:03:31.680] Knowledge Management why you should care
- [00:03:29.560 -> 00:03:33.599] about zal Casten the benefits of using a
- [00:03:31.680 -> 00:03:35.799] note-taking system like this a zetel
- [00:03:33.599 -> 00:03:37.959] Casten workflow in obsidian canvas
- [00:03:35.799 -> 00:03:40.159] mapping zetel Casten to my system which
- [00:03:37.959 -> 00:03:42.239] I call molecular zetel Casten mapping
- [00:03:40.159 -> 00:03:44.400] both zetel Casten and my molecular note
- [00:03:42.239 -> 00:03:47.400] taking to the code method from building
- [00:03:44.400 -> 00:03:49.519] a second brain capture organize distill
- [00:03:47.400 -> 00:03:51.080] Express outlining the goals of effective
- [00:03:49.519 -> 00:03:53.159] personal Knowledge Management so that
- [00:03:51.080 -> 00:03:55.280] you have a direction to use your notes
- [00:03:53.159 -> 00:03:57.040] simplifying the creation process Theory
- [00:03:55.280 -> 00:03:59.159] and mental models of personal Knowledge
- [00:03:57.040 -> 00:04:01.720] Management the knowledge feedback loop
- [00:03:59.159 -> 00:04:03.560] how you can consume data and information
- [00:04:01.720 -> 00:04:05.079] Forge it into knowledge and then share
- [00:04:03.560 -> 00:04:07.480] it with other people as information
- [00:04:05.079 -> 00:04:09.280] again Cal's eight laws of not taking
- [00:04:07.480 -> 00:04:11.239] what I try to keep in mind as I'm taking
- [00:04:09.280 -> 00:04:12.599] notes to simplify my system to help
- [00:04:11.239 -> 00:04:14.200] reduce the feeling of information
- [00:04:12.599 -> 00:04:16.320] overload I'm splitting this video into
- [00:04:14.200 -> 00:04:17.880] two parts this one is going to deal more
- [00:04:16.320 -> 00:04:20.479] with the theory and understanding of
- [00:04:17.880 -> 00:04:21.919] zetel Casten how it works and why you
- [00:04:20.479 -> 00:04:24.040] care about a system like this in the
- [00:04:21.919 -> 00:04:25.400] first place and in the second part I'm
- [00:04:24.040 -> 00:04:27.639] going to walk through more practical
- [00:04:25.400 -> 00:04:29.479] examples and a templating system on how
- [00:04:27.639 -> 00:04:31.560] I actually use my molecular zedcast
- [00:04:29.479 -> 00:04:33.759] andem system okay let's take a look at
- [00:04:31.560 -> 00:04:36.320] what zle cassin is to simplify zetel
- [00:04:33.759 -> 00:04:37.960] cassin as much as possible it's easier
- [00:04:36.320 -> 00:04:40.400] to think about it as two different
- [00:04:37.960 -> 00:04:43.160] systems we have an external management
- [00:04:40.400 -> 00:04:45.320] system and an internal management system
- [00:04:43.160 -> 00:04:48.120] the external system helps you keep track
- [00:04:45.320 -> 00:04:50.120] of sources and information from outside
- [00:04:48.120 -> 00:04:52.520] of yourself and the internal system is
- [00:04:50.120 -> 00:04:54.759] more of an idea generation box something
- [00:04:52.520 -> 00:04:57.400] that's based solely on your own ideas
- [00:04:54.759 -> 00:04:59.440] and insights the goal of zetel cassen is
- [00:04:57.400 -> 00:05:00.440] to keep track of where information came
- [00:04:59.440 -> 00:05:02.639] from
- [00:05:00.440 -> 00:05:04.560] and your own ideas so you can build on
- [00:05:02.639 -> 00:05:07.759] external information with your internal
- [00:05:04.560 -> 00:05:10.080] ideas originally Nicholas Lumen had two
- [00:05:07.759 -> 00:05:12.400] physical slip boxes he had one as a
- [00:05:10.080 -> 00:05:14.960] reference manager slip box and one as an
- [00:05:12.400 -> 00:05:17.320] idea generated slip box or a thinking
- [00:05:14.960 -> 00:05:18.919] slip box these two systems made it a lot
- [00:05:17.320 -> 00:05:20.800] easier in the physical world to keep
- [00:05:18.919 -> 00:05:22.360] track of where information came from
- [00:05:20.800 -> 00:05:24.360] than a digital system where we can just
- [00:05:22.360 -> 00:05:26.360] copy and paste all of the time so I'm
- [00:05:24.360 -> 00:05:28.440] going to modify this in a digital system
- [00:05:26.360 -> 00:05:29.960] so that it becomes easier to keep track
- [00:05:28.440 -> 00:05:32.199] of what is external and what what is
- [00:05:29.960 -> 00:05:34.280] internal in the physical system Nicholas
- [00:05:32.199 -> 00:05:37.680] Lumen needed a way to keep track of
- [00:05:34.280 -> 00:05:39.880] index cards the zetel in his zle casting
- [00:05:37.680 -> 00:05:41.960] so he used a reference manager system
- [00:05:39.880 -> 00:05:44.120] where he could file index cards one
- [00:05:41.960 -> 00:05:46.520] after another and then use a separate
- [00:05:44.120 -> 00:05:48.800] reference system to identify where the
- [00:05:46.520 -> 00:05:50.639] information was coming from that way he
- [00:05:48.800 -> 00:05:52.880] could always look at his main slip box
- [00:05:50.639 -> 00:05:54.720] the idea generating slip box and he
- [00:05:52.880 -> 00:05:56.560] could find the specific reference back
- [00:05:54.720 -> 00:05:57.840] in the reference manager system this is
- [00:05:56.560 -> 00:05:59.720] something we don't have to worry about
- [00:05:57.840 -> 00:06:01.400] in a digital system because obsidian
- [00:05:59.720 -> 00:06:03.280] takes care of all of that which I'll get
- [00:06:01.400 -> 00:06:05.800] into in a little bit now the original
- [00:06:03.280 -> 00:06:08.319] zle Casten system had three main note
- [00:06:05.800 -> 00:06:10.199] types the first were fleeting notes
- [00:06:08.319 -> 00:06:12.479] these are quick notes think jotting it
- [00:06:10.199 -> 00:06:14.880] down on a Post-It note then there are
- [00:06:12.479 -> 00:06:16.960] literature note which is key information
- [00:06:14.880 -> 00:06:19.000] from sources as you read a book you
- [00:06:16.960 -> 00:06:20.800] extract the ideas and the concepts and
- [00:06:19.000 -> 00:06:22.440] put it in your own word as a literature
- [00:06:20.800 -> 00:06:24.720] note this is part of the reference
- [00:06:22.440 -> 00:06:27.639] manager system and then the third type
- [00:06:24.720 -> 00:06:29.639] of note is the zle which is a permanent
- [00:06:27.639 -> 00:06:31.560] note and that is the type of note that
- [00:06:29.639 -> 00:06:34.560] goes inside of the main slip box or your
- [00:06:31.560 -> 00:06:36.479] own idea generation slip box these are
- [00:06:34.560 -> 00:06:38.520] key insights that have been crystallized
- [00:06:36.479 -> 00:06:39.960] in your own words also known as
- [00:06:38.520 -> 00:06:42.199] knowledge now let's look at each of
- [00:06:39.960 -> 00:06:44.520] these note types in more depth fleeting
- [00:06:42.199 -> 00:06:47.039] notes are quick notes these are thoughts
- [00:06:44.520 -> 00:06:48.680] that you have while on a walk or while
- [00:06:47.039 -> 00:06:50.560] having a conversation with someone
- [00:06:48.680 -> 00:06:52.880] you've had some experience it Sparks an
- [00:06:50.560 -> 00:06:54.080] idea and you want to quickly jot it down
- [00:06:52.880 -> 00:06:56.199] and you're not concerned about the
- [00:06:54.080 -> 00:06:58.400] format at all Fading notes are meant to
- [00:06:56.199 -> 00:07:00.199] be destroyed in the sense that you
- [00:06:58.400 -> 00:07:02.560] convert them into literature notes or
- [00:07:00.199 -> 00:07:04.919] permanent notes zal which is why they
- [00:07:02.560 -> 00:07:06.800] are fleeting they don't form part of the
- [00:07:04.919 -> 00:07:09.080] permanent system of literature notes or
- [00:07:06.800 -> 00:07:11.479] permanent notes literature notes are
- [00:07:09.080 -> 00:07:14.000] Atomic notes each note is meant to have
- [00:07:11.479 -> 00:07:16.360] one single concept you've extracted a
- [00:07:14.000 -> 00:07:18.520] quote and written it in your own words
- [00:07:16.360 -> 00:07:21.360] this could come from a podcast a book a
- [00:07:18.520 -> 00:07:23.720] video a conversation the idea is that
- [00:07:21.360 -> 00:07:26.440] you take the information that you just
- [00:07:23.720 -> 00:07:28.400] consumed and you distill it into a form
- [00:07:26.440 -> 00:07:30.360] that will remind you of that note in the
- [00:07:28.400 -> 00:07:32.759] future that will REM remind you of that
- [00:07:30.360 -> 00:07:34.919] key idea or key concept of the
- [00:07:32.759 -> 00:07:37.039] information that you consumed and these
- [00:07:34.919 -> 00:07:38.720] are always linked back to the original
- [00:07:37.039 -> 00:07:40.560] source which is why they're called
- [00:07:38.720 -> 00:07:42.479] literature notes I personally think of
- [00:07:40.560 -> 00:07:45.039] them more as Source notes literature
- [00:07:42.479 -> 00:07:47.240] notes are understandable in the context
- [00:07:45.039 -> 00:07:49.039] of the source so that you can go back
- [00:07:47.240 -> 00:07:51.120] later and know exactly where the
- [00:07:49.039 -> 00:07:52.919] information came from this is why they
- [00:07:51.120 -> 00:07:55.240] form part of the reference manager slip
- [00:07:52.919 -> 00:07:57.240] box in the zcast and system and the
- [00:07:55.240 -> 00:07:59.039] third type of note is the permanent note
- [00:07:57.240 -> 00:08:00.000] these are crystallized insights or
- [00:07:59.039 -> 00:08:01.879] knowledge
- [00:08:00.000 -> 00:08:03.599] that come from taking the concepts that
- [00:08:01.879 -> 00:08:05.599] you've reviewed inside of the literature
- [00:08:03.599 -> 00:08:07.639] notes and your fleeting notes and you
- [00:08:05.599 -> 00:08:09.759] combine them together to form a
- [00:08:07.639 -> 00:08:12.199] permanent piece of knowledge inside of
- [00:08:09.759 -> 00:08:14.720] your main slip box inside of your idea
- [00:08:12.199 -> 00:08:16.280] generated slip box this could have one
- [00:08:14.720 -> 00:08:18.120] or more Concepts but typically you want
- [00:08:16.280 -> 00:08:19.560] to keep them as short as possible
- [00:08:18.120 -> 00:08:21.639] because the point of using permanent
- [00:08:19.560 -> 00:08:23.720] notes is that we'll be able to sequence
- [00:08:21.639 -> 00:08:25.560] them in the future to produce other
- [00:08:23.720 -> 00:08:27.360] types of content you can kind of think
- [00:08:25.560 -> 00:08:29.039] of them like building blocks or Lego
- [00:08:27.360 -> 00:08:31.319] blocks permanent notes are
- [00:08:29.039 -> 00:08:33.360] understandable out of context but
- [00:08:31.319 -> 00:08:35.479] they're linked to the original sources
- [00:08:33.360 -> 00:08:36.919] via literature notes for example have
- [00:08:35.479 -> 00:08:38.599] you ever gone back to a note that you
- [00:08:36.919 -> 00:08:40.719] wrote six months ago and you have no
- [00:08:38.599 -> 00:08:42.959] idea what it was you were writing it for
- [00:08:40.719 -> 00:08:45.440] or where the idea came from permanent
- [00:08:42.959 -> 00:08:47.720] notes try to solve this problem by
- [00:08:45.440 -> 00:08:50.080] decontextualizing the information so
- [00:08:47.720 -> 00:08:52.040] that it is understandable in and of
- [00:08:50.080 -> 00:08:53.839] itself without needing to go read
- [00:08:52.040 -> 00:08:55.519] something else and if you want to
- [00:08:53.839 -> 00:08:57.440] recontextualize it if you want to go
- [00:08:55.519 -> 00:08:59.560] back and find out where the information
- [00:08:57.440 -> 00:09:01.399] was inspired from where the knowledge
- [00:08:59.560 -> 00:09:03.519] occurred you can go take a look at the
- [00:09:01.399 -> 00:09:05.079] reference manager slip box as the
- [00:09:03.519 -> 00:09:06.880] literature note system the most
- [00:09:05.079 -> 00:09:08.760] simplified version of zedel cassen the
- [00:09:06.880 -> 00:09:10.640] easiest way that I found to understand
- [00:09:08.760 -> 00:09:13.240] it is to keep in mind that there are
- [00:09:10.640 -> 00:09:15.680] always two systems we have an external
- [00:09:13.240 -> 00:09:17.680] slip box for information from sources
- [00:09:15.680 -> 00:09:19.560] and we have an internal slip box which
- [00:09:17.680 -> 00:09:22.399] is a conversion of those external
- [00:09:19.560 -> 00:09:24.360] sources mixed with our own ideas so that
- [00:09:22.399 -> 00:09:25.920] we always know which was our idea and
- [00:09:24.360 -> 00:09:28.279] which came from someone else you can
- [00:09:25.920 -> 00:09:30.079] think of the external slip box as the
- [00:09:28.279 -> 00:09:32.120] thoughts of others in information that
- [00:09:30.079 -> 00:09:33.560] you're consuming from external sources
- [00:09:32.120 -> 00:09:35.079] these are converted into literature
- [00:09:33.560 -> 00:09:37.200] notes which are kind of like the
- [00:09:35.079 -> 00:09:39.320] permanent Source notes for information
- [00:09:37.200 -> 00:09:41.000] extractions from the sources you then
- [00:09:39.320 -> 00:09:43.200] have some kind of reference manager for
- [00:09:41.000 -> 00:09:45.120] citations to keep track of the
- [00:09:43.200 -> 00:09:47.040] literature notes in the sources and Link
- [00:09:45.120 -> 00:09:48.680] them together a digital system also
- [00:09:47.040 -> 00:09:50.440] enables fleeting notes to be put in
- [00:09:48.680 -> 00:09:52.440] sources because we're dealing with the
- [00:09:50.440 -> 00:09:54.200] Abundant world of the digital realm but
- [00:09:52.440 -> 00:09:55.959] I'll get into more of that later and
- [00:09:54.200 -> 00:09:58.040] then we have a second slip box for
- [00:09:55.959 -> 00:10:01.079] internal thinking thoughts of my own a
- [00:09:58.040 -> 00:10:03.240] thinking box or an IDE generator box
- [00:10:01.079 -> 00:10:05.519] this box stores our permanent notes
- [00:10:03.240 -> 00:10:08.200] which I call molecules or think of as
- [00:10:05.519 -> 00:10:10.760] linked Concepts this box stores thoughts
- [00:10:08.200 -> 00:10:12.959] ideas and crystallizations of insights
- [00:10:10.760 -> 00:10:15.160] that apply to your own projects problem
- [00:10:12.959 -> 00:10:17.800] or life you can think of it of keeping
- [00:10:15.160 -> 00:10:20.279] track of your actual knowledge and ideas
- [00:10:17.800 -> 00:10:22.200] now this system might seem like Overkill
- [00:10:20.279 -> 00:10:24.440] and to be honest I thought so at first
- [00:10:22.200 -> 00:10:26.360] too but the more I looked into this the
- [00:10:24.440 -> 00:10:28.800] more I recognized that we consume more
- [00:10:26.360 -> 00:10:30.720] information than ever and by having a
- [00:10:28.800 -> 00:10:32.880] system that allows us to keep track of
- [00:10:30.720 -> 00:10:34.800] what is external and what is internal we
- [00:10:32.880 -> 00:10:36.959] can then take the time to focus on the
- [00:10:34.800 -> 00:10:39.959] internal to review our own thoughts and
- [00:10:36.959 -> 00:10:42.720] ideas which really boosts originality
- [00:10:39.959 -> 00:10:45.720] and Ingenuity and allows us to find and
- [00:10:42.720 -> 00:10:48.440] build on our own ideas using an external
- [00:10:45.720 -> 00:10:50.680] mind a second brain or a digital brain
- [00:10:48.440 -> 00:10:52.000] helps us deal with information overload
- [00:10:50.680 -> 00:10:54.399] as part of our personal Knowledge
- [00:10:52.000 -> 00:10:56.639] Management System we can filter and
- [00:10:54.399 -> 00:10:58.480] process information from others convert
- [00:10:56.639 -> 00:11:00.880] it into our own knowledge so that we're
- [00:10:58.480 -> 00:11:02.519] not feeling over whelmed and then share
- [00:11:00.880 -> 00:11:04.880] the value of that knowledge with other
- [00:11:02.519 -> 00:11:06.639] people the zle Casten system allows us
- [00:11:04.880 -> 00:11:08.720] to keep track of the information that
- [00:11:06.639 -> 00:11:10.720] we're getting from external sources and
- [00:11:08.720 -> 00:11:13.000] how we've modified it inside of our
- [00:11:10.720 -> 00:11:15.440] second brain to produce knowledge that's
- [00:11:13.000 -> 00:11:17.639] applicable to our own lives zetel Casten
- [00:11:15.440 -> 00:11:19.440] also helps us measure productivity by
- [00:11:17.639 -> 00:11:22.200] tracking the number of permanent notes
- [00:11:19.440 -> 00:11:23.720] created an indication of truly
- [00:11:22.200 -> 00:11:25.800] understanding concepts rather than
- [00:11:23.720 -> 00:11:27.639] looking at my entire note base or the
- [00:11:25.800 -> 00:11:30.120] entire internet when looking for new
- [00:11:27.639 -> 00:11:32.200] information I can in instead constrain
- [00:11:30.120 -> 00:11:35.079] my search to my existing knowledge
- [00:11:32.200 -> 00:11:37.079] system this greatly simplifies my review
- [00:11:35.079 -> 00:11:39.600] of information that I've consumed in
- [00:11:37.079 -> 00:11:41.800] processed in the past and reduces
- [00:11:39.600 -> 00:11:43.800] information overload it's not possible
- [00:11:41.800 -> 00:11:45.839] to be overloaded by knowledge we just
- [00:11:43.800 -> 00:11:47.360] get overloaded by information here's a
- [00:11:45.839 -> 00:11:49.720] quote from the book how to take smart
- [00:11:47.360 -> 00:11:51.959] notes most organizational note-taking
- [00:11:49.720 -> 00:11:55.240] decisions can be made upfront once and
- [00:11:51.959 -> 00:11:57.800] for all by deciding on one system so
- [00:11:55.240 -> 00:11:59.680] let's create that system let's structure
- [00:11:57.800 -> 00:12:01.320] a system so that we never never have to
- [00:11:59.680 -> 00:12:03.160] think about where the notes are going or
- [00:12:01.320 -> 00:12:05.079] how we're going to organize it we can
- [00:12:03.160 -> 00:12:07.399] take all of that energy that went into
- [00:12:05.079 -> 00:12:08.880] deciding on the organization system or
- [00:12:07.399 -> 00:12:12.040] perhaps triggered organizational
- [00:12:08.880 -> 00:12:14.639] paralysis analysis paralysis and instead
- [00:12:12.040 -> 00:12:17.560] use that energy and time to build up our
- [00:12:14.639 -> 00:12:19.240] own ideas based on a secure knowledge
- [00:12:17.560 -> 00:12:20.360] system I want to note that in the second
- [00:12:19.240 -> 00:12:22.480] part of this video I'm going to be
- [00:12:20.360 -> 00:12:24.720] walking through my templating system in
- [00:12:22.480 -> 00:12:27.399] obsidian how I converted zetel Casten
- [00:12:24.720 -> 00:12:29.279] into what I call molecular zetel Casten
- [00:12:27.399 -> 00:12:31.519] and the templates and inboxes for this
- [00:12:29.279 -> 00:12:33.560] system I'm going to produce a zip file
- [00:12:31.519 -> 00:12:35.480] of this vault as a starter kit for
- [00:12:33.560 -> 00:12:37.560] molecular zcas and that will be
- [00:12:35.480 -> 00:12:39.839] available to the paying members of my
- [00:12:37.560 -> 00:12:42.399] YouTube membership at the lowest tier
- [00:12:39.839 -> 00:12:45.360] which is currently $2.99 Canadian around
- [00:12:42.399 -> 00:12:47.240] $2 us so if you find this information
- [00:12:45.360 -> 00:12:48.639] valuable and you want to support me for
- [00:12:47.240 -> 00:12:50.320] the hundreds of hours that I put into
- [00:12:48.639 -> 00:12:51.920] building this system I would have really
- [00:12:50.320 -> 00:12:53.959] appreciate if you would consider joining
- [00:12:51.920 -> 00:12:55.519] the community it's also a great place to
- [00:12:53.959 -> 00:12:57.240] talk about this with other people so
- [00:12:55.519 -> 00:13:00.199] that we can each build and customize the
- [00:12:57.240 -> 00:13:02.240] system ourselves okay now let's take a
- [00:13:00.199 -> 00:13:04.279] look at zle Caston more in depth I want
- [00:13:02.240 -> 00:13:07.240] to talk a bit about the main benefits of
- [00:13:04.279 -> 00:13:08.720] zle Caston the more you understand why
- [00:13:07.240 -> 00:13:10.360] this system is valuable and how it
- [00:13:08.720 -> 00:13:12.440] applies to your own life the more you
- [00:13:10.360 -> 00:13:14.600] align it with your own goals the more
- [00:13:12.440 -> 00:13:15.959] practical and less abstract this system
- [00:13:14.600 -> 00:13:17.760] becomes here are some of the key
- [00:13:15.959 -> 00:13:19.760] principles of using my molecular zedal
- [00:13:17.760 -> 00:13:21.480] Casten system which is the digitized
- [00:13:19.760 -> 00:13:24.000] version of zetel Casten along with a few
- [00:13:21.480 -> 00:13:25.720] of my own note types the zetting system
- [00:13:24.000 -> 00:13:27.680] allows you to Leverage The Generation
- [00:13:25.720 -> 00:13:29.720] effect when you take information and you
- [00:13:27.680 -> 00:13:31.600] convert it into your own word
- [00:13:29.720 -> 00:13:33.560] the process of translating this into
- [00:13:31.600 -> 00:13:35.320] your own words helps you remember it and
- [00:13:33.560 -> 00:13:37.440] makes it more applicable in the future
- [00:13:35.320 -> 00:13:39.600] using a zetting system allows you to
- [00:13:37.440 -> 00:13:41.040] offload your working memory you don't
- [00:13:39.600 -> 00:13:42.920] have to remember everything you can
- [00:13:41.040 -> 00:13:44.839] instead store it inside of your second
- [00:13:42.920 -> 00:13:46.959] brain which drastically reduces your
- [00:13:44.839 -> 00:13:48.880] information overload because instead of
- [00:13:46.959 -> 00:13:50.880] focusing on the working memory trying to
- [00:13:48.880 -> 00:13:53.519] keep everything in mind you can instead
- [00:13:50.880 -> 00:13:55.240] focus more on the insights and the ideas
- [00:13:53.519 -> 00:13:57.320] themselves the molecular zoc cassm
- [00:13:55.240 -> 00:13:59.639] system in obsidian allows for an
- [00:13:57.320 -> 00:14:02.519] emergent growth opportunity there's
- [00:13:59.639 -> 00:14:03.880] exponential growth 2 to the nth power
- [00:14:02.519 -> 00:14:05.120] each connection you make between a
- [00:14:03.880 -> 00:14:07.160] different note allows for more
- [00:14:05.120 -> 00:14:08.759] connections to other notes and over time
- [00:14:07.160 -> 00:14:10.880] you end up building a critical mass of
- [00:14:08.759 -> 00:14:12.440] notes that can lead to whatever it is
- [00:14:10.880 -> 00:14:15.079] you're trying to do you can think of
- [00:14:12.440 -> 00:14:16.839] this kind of like bamboo for the first
- [00:14:15.079 -> 00:14:18.519] three years all you have to do with
- [00:14:16.839 -> 00:14:20.399] bamboo is water it it doesn't really
- [00:14:18.519 -> 00:14:22.040] come above the ground but then in the
- [00:14:20.399 -> 00:14:24.920] fourth year all of the sudden it
- [00:14:22.040 -> 00:14:28.480] explodes and it generates up to 90 ft or
- [00:14:24.920 -> 00:14:31.120] 30 m within 2 months a zcast and system
- [00:14:28.480 -> 00:14:33.560] and my ular zle Casten system is kind of
- [00:14:31.120 -> 00:14:34.720] like this bamboo at first you're just
- [00:14:33.560 -> 00:14:36.199] adding more and more notes you're
- [00:14:34.720 -> 00:14:37.600] building out your literature notes and
- [00:14:36.199 -> 00:14:40.160] then you're building out your permanent
- [00:14:37.600 -> 00:14:41.480] note inbox but over time eventually
- [00:14:40.160 -> 00:14:43.320] you'll make enough connections that
- [00:14:41.480 -> 00:14:45.480] something will become very emergent it
- [00:14:43.320 -> 00:14:47.199] will appear and you'll be shocked that
- [00:14:45.480 -> 00:14:48.720] you never did this in the first place I
- [00:14:47.199 -> 00:14:50.519] actually attended a lecture series as
- [00:14:48.720 -> 00:14:53.079] part of the Hinton lectures by Jeffrey
- [00:14:50.519 -> 00:14:54.759] Hinton The Godfather of AI where he
- [00:14:53.079 -> 00:14:57.279] talked about the emergent property of
- [00:14:54.759 -> 00:14:59.240] data for a long time for literally
- [00:14:57.279 -> 00:15:01.000] billions of parameters it seems as
- [00:14:59.240 -> 00:15:02.759] though nothing has happened all of a
- [00:15:01.000 -> 00:15:04.600] sudden you hit a billion parameters and
- [00:15:02.759 -> 00:15:06.880] it goes vertical there's an emergent
- [00:15:04.600 -> 00:15:08.639] property the zalasin system is kind of
- [00:15:06.880 -> 00:15:10.959] like this especially when applied in
- [00:15:08.639 -> 00:15:13.880] obsidian the zetoc Casten system also
- [00:15:10.959 -> 00:15:16.120] allows for original Insight synthesis
- [00:15:13.880 -> 00:15:18.040] I'll map this to Bloom's taxonomy later
- [00:15:16.120 -> 00:15:20.199] which structures a system for original
- [00:15:18.040 -> 00:15:22.000] thinking using obsidian in particular
- [00:15:20.199 -> 00:15:24.600] allows you to literally map your
- [00:15:22.000 -> 00:15:26.759] knowledge insights and wisdom the graph
- [00:15:24.600 -> 00:15:28.399] view the visualization in obsidian can
- [00:15:26.759 -> 00:15:30.639] be incredibly helpful for making new
- [00:15:28.399 -> 00:15:32.560] connections and is a major perk compared
- [00:15:30.639 -> 00:15:34.440] to the physical zel Casten system and
- [00:15:32.560 -> 00:15:36.279] finally the main benefit is that you're
- [00:15:34.440 -> 00:15:38.519] standardizing a system of building
- [00:15:36.279 -> 00:15:41.000] blocks like Lego where you can reuse
- [00:15:38.519 -> 00:15:42.079] your notes in an infinite number of ways
- [00:15:41.000 -> 00:15:44.360] you don't have to think about the
- [00:15:42.079 -> 00:15:46.639] organization or structure which frees up
- [00:15:44.360 -> 00:15:49.040] your mind to focus on the ideas and
- [00:15:46.639 -> 00:15:50.440] learning the more critical mass you
- [00:15:49.040 -> 00:15:52.759] begin generating inside of your
- [00:15:50.440 -> 00:15:54.199] permanent note slip box the more note
- [00:15:52.759 -> 00:15:56.480] sequences you can make in different
- [00:15:54.199 -> 00:15:58.759] combinations which helps you generate a
- [00:15:56.480 -> 00:16:00.639] lot of new and interesting ideas all of
- [00:15:58.759 -> 00:16:03.639] what I'm talking about so far fits under
- [00:16:00.639 -> 00:16:05.519] the category of PKM or personal
- [00:16:03.639 -> 00:16:06.600] Knowledge Management now that I've
- [00:16:05.519 -> 00:16:08.920] explained a little bit more about the
- [00:16:06.600 -> 00:16:11.480] zle Casten system with a touch of
- [00:16:08.920 -> 00:16:13.240] obsidian let's give a brief overview on
- [00:16:11.480 -> 00:16:15.399] my molecular note system that I use
- [00:16:13.240 -> 00:16:17.160] inside of obsidian my system modifies
- [00:16:15.399 -> 00:16:19.240] the original zle Casten system to take
- [00:16:17.160 -> 00:16:21.319] into account the code method of note
- [00:16:19.240 -> 00:16:24.800] taking by Teo Forte and building a
- [00:16:21.319 -> 00:16:27.399] second brain stands for capture organize
- [00:16:24.800 -> 00:16:29.199] distill and express this takes the
- [00:16:27.399 -> 00:16:31.319] original zle cting system and and
- [00:16:29.199 -> 00:16:32.639] modifies it for the digital world in a
- [00:16:31.319 -> 00:16:34.680] way that really allows you to take
- [00:16:32.639 -> 00:16:37.360] advantage of tools like obsidian and
- [00:16:34.680 -> 00:16:39.319] notebook LM systems that you can truly
- [00:16:37.360 -> 00:16:40.920] begin to augment your personal Knowledge
- [00:16:39.319 -> 00:16:42.839] Management rather than dealing with an
- [00:16:40.920 -> 00:16:44.959] atomic notetaking system like zetel
- [00:16:42.839 -> 00:16:46.920] Casten I've modified mine to be
- [00:16:44.959 -> 00:16:48.319] molecular to level up the existing
- [00:16:46.920 -> 00:16:50.079] system to take into account a few
- [00:16:48.319 -> 00:16:51.959] different note types let's take a look
- [00:16:50.079 -> 00:16:54.399] similar to zle Casten we have the
- [00:16:51.959 -> 00:16:56.680] capture component which is fleeting
- [00:16:54.399 -> 00:16:59.079] notes and in my system these are Source
- [00:16:56.680 -> 00:17:01.160] notes daily notes and new notes then we
- [00:16:59.079 -> 00:17:03.920] move on to the organized component of
- [00:17:01.160 -> 00:17:06.360] code organization nodes like topics and
- [00:17:03.920 -> 00:17:09.240] tags in the original zle cting system he
- [00:17:06.360 -> 00:17:10.959] didn't use topics or tags because he was
- [00:17:09.240 -> 00:17:12.160] writing on index cards and it would be
- [00:17:10.959 -> 00:17:14.520] difficult to go through and structure
- [00:17:12.160 -> 00:17:16.760] new folder systems in obsidian this is
- [00:17:14.520 -> 00:17:19.400] completely mot and opens the door to a
- [00:17:16.760 -> 00:17:21.199] lot better organization distill my
- [00:17:19.400 -> 00:17:23.160] distilled notes are atoms which are
- [00:17:21.199 -> 00:17:25.160] literature notes and molecules which are
- [00:17:23.160 -> 00:17:27.360] permanent notes this is very similar to
- [00:17:25.160 -> 00:17:29.520] the original zle Casten system finally
- [00:17:27.360 -> 00:17:31.760] we get to the express part of code
- [00:17:29.520 -> 00:17:33.440] publishable notes which I call Alloys
- [00:17:31.760 -> 00:17:35.080] because I have a material science
- [00:17:33.440 -> 00:17:36.799] background and when you get a bunch of
- [00:17:35.080 -> 00:17:38.880] atoms and molecules and combine them you
- [00:17:36.799 -> 00:17:40.440] can build Alloys in Metallurgy
- [00:17:38.880 -> 00:17:42.080] effectively what I'm doing is I'm using
- [00:17:40.440 -> 00:17:44.280] the code method from building a second
- [00:17:42.080 -> 00:17:46.559] brain and the zle Casten method to
- [00:17:44.280 -> 00:17:49.440] structure three different boxes we have
- [00:17:46.559 -> 00:17:52.000] the inbox the consuming box where we
- [00:17:49.440 -> 00:17:54.280] read and watch videos and consume
- [00:17:52.000 -> 00:17:55.679] podcasts we have the thinking section
- [00:17:54.280 -> 00:17:57.720] which is the slip box where we take
- [00:17:55.679 -> 00:17:59.320] notes and modify them and then we have
- [00:17:57.720 -> 00:18:02.039] the outbox which is the publishing
- [00:17:59.320 -> 00:18:03.679] component I use my topics and tags in a
- [00:18:02.039 -> 00:18:05.919] way that allows me to structure for
- [00:18:03.679 -> 00:18:08.200] emergence inside of my obsidian which
- [00:18:05.919 -> 00:18:10.799] leads to Untold value and unpredictable
- [00:18:08.200 -> 00:18:12.679] value I talk more about the tags versus
- [00:18:10.799 -> 00:18:14.559] topics system that I use to structure my
- [00:18:12.679 -> 00:18:15.840] molecular note taking in another video
- [00:18:14.559 -> 00:18:17.919] so I recommend checking that out if
- [00:18:15.840 -> 00:18:19.960] you're interested in how to modify your
- [00:18:17.919 -> 00:18:22.120] system for emergence okay now let's
- [00:18:19.960 -> 00:18:23.919] actually take a look at the zle Casten
- [00:18:22.120 -> 00:18:26.200] system itself where I'm going to map
- [00:18:23.919 -> 00:18:27.480] this in the canvas tool in obsidian and
- [00:18:26.200 -> 00:18:29.480] then I'm going to convert it into my
- [00:18:27.480 -> 00:18:31.200] molecular note system before touching
- [00:18:29.480 -> 00:18:33.080] more on personal Knowledge Management
- [00:18:31.200 -> 00:18:35.159] theory that I hope will help make this
- [00:18:33.080 -> 00:18:37.360] system feel a lot more concrete and less
- [00:18:35.159 -> 00:18:39.159] abstract let's dive in okay so here's
- [00:18:37.360 -> 00:18:40.520] where I left off after my beginner
- [00:18:39.159 -> 00:18:42.640] obsidian tutorial so I thought this
- [00:18:40.520 -> 00:18:45.280] would be a good Vault to work on to show
- [00:18:42.640 -> 00:18:47.760] you the benefits of a zle Caston system
- [00:18:45.280 -> 00:18:49.919] and how I apply that zle Casten system
- [00:18:47.760 -> 00:18:51.280] to my own system called molecular notes
- [00:18:49.919 -> 00:18:52.760] I first came across the concept of
- [00:18:51.280 -> 00:18:55.760] molecular notes from reasonable
- [00:18:52.760 -> 00:18:57.559] deviations tocom Robert Martin took some
- [00:18:55.760 -> 00:18:59.520] of the concepts from zedel Casten and
- [00:18:57.559 -> 00:19:01.679] applied his own system to it so I've
- [00:18:59.520 -> 00:19:03.400] taken Robert's system of molecular notes
- [00:19:01.679 -> 00:19:05.760] and added my own thoughts to it where
- [00:19:03.400 -> 00:19:07.600] I've expanded to include an additional
- [00:19:05.760 -> 00:19:09.919] category and bring in some more Concepts
- [00:19:07.600 -> 00:19:12.000] from zle Casten so before we get started
- [00:19:09.919 -> 00:19:14.840] I just thought that it would make sense
- [00:19:12.000 -> 00:19:16.880] to change the default theme to adom
- [00:19:14.840 -> 00:19:18.000] because this is my preferred theme and
- [00:19:16.880 -> 00:19:19.799] since we're going to be working with
- [00:19:18.000 -> 00:19:21.320] atomic note taking I thought that seemed
- [00:19:19.799 -> 00:19:22.400] fitting okay and I'm also going to try
- [00:19:21.320 -> 00:19:24.600] something a little different here I'm
- [00:19:22.400 -> 00:19:27.039] going to create a new canvas and I'm
- [00:19:24.600 -> 00:19:29.240] going to use the canvas to walk through
- [00:19:27.039 -> 00:19:31.080] the various features of zedcast and my
- [00:19:29.240 -> 00:19:33.159] own molecular note system so that you
- [00:19:31.080 -> 00:19:35.039] have a bit of a map of what's going on
- [00:19:33.159 -> 00:19:36.960] with this system you can see a bit of a
- [00:19:35.039 -> 00:19:39.159] workflow here and hopefully that will
- [00:19:36.960 -> 00:19:40.919] help you visualize how all of the pieces
- [00:19:39.159 -> 00:19:42.240] of this system come together so what
- [00:19:40.919 -> 00:19:43.840] I've done here is I've taken some of my
- [00:19:42.240 -> 00:19:46.120] favorite Concepts on Knowledge
- [00:19:43.840 -> 00:19:48.120] Management and I've applied it to the
- [00:19:46.120 -> 00:19:51.120] code method which I talked about last
- [00:19:48.120 -> 00:19:53.000] time so I can drag a note in here you
- [00:19:51.120 -> 00:19:56.000] can see that code has four different
- [00:19:53.000 -> 00:19:58.240] elements to it it has capture organize
- [00:19:56.000 -> 00:19:59.600] distill and express before we get too
- [00:19:58.240 -> 00:20:02.280] deep into this I thought it would be
- [00:19:59.600 -> 00:20:05.799] helpful to explain the zcast and
- [00:20:02.280 -> 00:20:08.240] Primitives next I will map zedel castom
- [00:20:05.799 -> 00:20:10.400] to molecular notes which is to molecular
- [00:20:08.240 -> 00:20:12.720] notes which is my system for operating
- [00:20:10.400 -> 00:20:14.960] and then I'll create templates for each
- [00:20:12.720 -> 00:20:17.080] of the note Primitives okay so now if we
- [00:20:14.960 -> 00:20:19.240] take a look at my notes here I've
- [00:20:17.080 -> 00:20:21.280] expanded on the code method capture
- [00:20:19.240 -> 00:20:23.200] organized distill and express and I've
- [00:20:21.280 -> 00:20:24.760] included the different note types from
- [00:20:23.200 -> 00:20:27.360] the zle Casten system that I just
- [00:20:24.760 -> 00:20:29.960] explained and I've mapped the zcast and
- [00:20:27.360 -> 00:20:31.000] system to my own ular note system so you
- [00:20:29.960 -> 00:20:32.880] can see here that there's a few
- [00:20:31.000 -> 00:20:35.720] different note types each of these note
- [00:20:32.880 -> 00:20:37.480] types are indicated by a tag a hashtag
- [00:20:35.720 -> 00:20:39.159] I'll get more into tags when I get into
- [00:20:37.480 -> 00:20:40.880] the actual creation of templates as a
- [00:20:39.159 -> 00:20:42.720] part of this molecular system but I do
- [00:20:40.880 -> 00:20:45.480] have a separate video that goes deep
- [00:20:42.720 -> 00:20:47.799] into the comparison of tags versus topic
- [00:20:45.480 -> 00:20:49.520] notes and how I use each of those so if
- [00:20:47.799 -> 00:20:51.360] you're confused at all about topics or
- [00:20:49.520 -> 00:20:53.080] tags as we go through this I recommend
- [00:20:51.360 -> 00:20:54.679] checking out that video and the edcast
- [00:20:53.080 -> 00:20:56.559] and system if you recall there's two
- [00:20:54.679 -> 00:20:58.600] different slip boxes there's the
- [00:20:56.559 -> 00:21:00.840] reference slip box and then there is the
- [00:20:58.600 -> 00:21:02.840] the main slip box the reference slip box
- [00:21:00.840 -> 00:21:05.200] is made up of bibliographic notes which
- [00:21:02.840 -> 00:21:07.600] come from sources and also literature
- [00:21:05.200 -> 00:21:09.280] notes that are tied to a citation that
- [00:21:07.600 -> 00:21:11.240] you got from the source but are an
- [00:21:09.280 -> 00:21:13.480] extraction so this is what I'm going to
- [00:21:11.240 -> 00:21:15.559] call an atom because it's a singular
- [00:21:13.480 -> 00:21:17.760] Atomic concept that I've pulled out of a
- [00:21:15.559 -> 00:21:20.120] source note now Source notes are a type
- [00:21:17.760 -> 00:21:21.840] of fleeting note because I just jot down
- [00:21:20.120 -> 00:21:23.919] whatever thoughts come to mind as I'm
- [00:21:21.840 -> 00:21:26.080] reading the source and then I go through
- [00:21:23.919 -> 00:21:28.400] and extract the insights and the ideas I
- [00:21:26.080 -> 00:21:31.440] had into my permanent slip box which is
- [00:21:28.400 -> 00:21:33.480] my main slip box and also into atoms so
- [00:21:31.440 -> 00:21:36.159] I use the source as kind of the raw
- [00:21:33.480 -> 00:21:38.880] material that I then mine atoms or
- [00:21:36.159 -> 00:21:40.480] extract atoms and also extract the ideas
- [00:21:38.880 -> 00:21:42.440] and thoughts and combine them with atoms
- [00:21:40.480 -> 00:21:44.480] to create molecules this provides a
- [00:21:42.440 -> 00:21:46.559] really simple way for me to keep track
- [00:21:44.480 -> 00:21:47.919] of where I got ideas from the direct
- [00:21:46.559 -> 00:21:50.480] source because it's tied to the
- [00:21:47.919 -> 00:21:52.679] reference system but also a way that I
- [00:21:50.480 -> 00:21:54.440] can keep track of my own ideas as I go
- [00:21:52.679 -> 00:21:55.679] through and create that source so then
- [00:21:54.440 -> 00:21:57.279] there's also a daily note which is
- [00:21:55.679 -> 00:21:58.720] another type of fleeing note and
- [00:21:57.279 -> 00:22:00.320] basically that's just a way where I can
- [00:21:58.720 -> 00:22:02.559] go and click a button on the side and it
- [00:22:00.320 -> 00:22:04.320] will create a new note for me so this is
- [00:22:02.559 -> 00:22:06.640] like a Dumping Ground where I'll drop
- [00:22:04.320 -> 00:22:08.760] thoughts ideas Concepts things I want to
- [00:22:06.640 -> 00:22:10.960] look into questions any thought that
- [00:22:08.760 -> 00:22:12.799] comes to my mind any fleeting thought
- [00:22:10.960 -> 00:22:14.760] I'll add here as a fleeting note both
- [00:22:12.799 -> 00:22:16.679] daily notes and Source notes are
- [00:22:14.760 -> 00:22:18.400] considered part of the capture system
- [00:22:16.679 -> 00:22:20.039] organization is done through topics and
- [00:22:18.400 -> 00:22:21.919] tags which again I talk about more in
- [00:22:20.039 -> 00:22:23.919] another video and then I go through and
- [00:22:21.919 -> 00:22:26.520] distill those captured notes those
- [00:22:23.919 -> 00:22:28.240] fleeting notes into atoms and molecules
- [00:22:26.520 -> 00:22:29.640] so both atoms and molecules can be
- [00:22:28.240 -> 00:22:31.880] consider considered a type of permanent
- [00:22:29.640 -> 00:22:34.000] note in the sense that I've distilled
- [00:22:31.880 -> 00:22:35.720] their Essence down to the core concept
- [00:22:34.000 -> 00:22:37.520] so that I can use it as a building block
- [00:22:35.720 -> 00:22:39.400] elsewhere and then finally we get to the
- [00:22:37.520 -> 00:22:41.200] express section which is what I call an
- [00:22:39.400 -> 00:22:43.000] alloy because Alloys are made up of
- [00:22:41.200 -> 00:22:44.840] multiple molecules and these are
- [00:22:43.000 -> 00:22:47.279] everything that gets published it's part
- [00:22:44.840 -> 00:22:49.039] of what I build in public so this could
- [00:22:47.279 -> 00:22:50.840] go into my digital Garden this could go
- [00:22:49.039 -> 00:22:52.960] into my newsletter into my YouTube
- [00:22:50.840 -> 00:22:54.919] videos and eventually because I'm
- [00:22:52.960 -> 00:22:57.440] keeping track of all the citations I can
- [00:22:54.919 -> 00:22:59.080] also use it to print academic papers or
- [00:22:57.440 -> 00:23:00.640] write a book while keeping track of my
- [00:22:59.080 -> 00:23:02.640] sources if you would like to consider
- [00:23:00.640 -> 00:23:05.039] this more in the digital Garden analogy
- [00:23:02.640 -> 00:23:06.919] you can think of the source note or the
- [00:23:05.039 -> 00:23:09.720] daily note the fleeting note as a place
- [00:23:06.919 -> 00:23:12.039] where I have idea seeds and over time I
- [00:23:09.720 -> 00:23:14.120] cultivate those seeds into atoms and
- [00:23:12.039 -> 00:23:16.200] molecules so that they become trees
- [00:23:14.120 -> 00:23:18.440] which are a more refined version of the
- [00:23:16.200 -> 00:23:20.600] fleeting node an expansion on the seed
- [00:23:18.440 -> 00:23:22.120] as I cultivate those trees over time
- [00:23:20.600 -> 00:23:24.159] they begin to bear fruit which are the
- [00:23:22.120 -> 00:23:25.720] Alloys that I then share in public again
- [00:23:24.159 -> 00:23:27.440] I know that this is a lot of information
- [00:23:25.720 -> 00:23:29.120] so I'm going to break through it step by
- [00:23:27.440 -> 00:23:31.480] step so that each pie piece becomes a
- [00:23:29.120 -> 00:23:33.240] lot clearer here are the basic zedcast
- [00:23:31.480 -> 00:23:35.039] derivatives that I just talked about
- [00:23:33.240 -> 00:23:36.880] fleeting notes literature notes
- [00:23:35.039 -> 00:23:38.640] permanent notes and then bibliographic
- [00:23:36.880 -> 00:23:40.000] notes and if you remember there are two
- [00:23:38.640 -> 00:23:41.720] different slip boxes that we're dealing
- [00:23:40.000 -> 00:23:43.760] with we're dealing with a reference
- [00:23:41.720 -> 00:23:46.039] manager slip boox and we're dealing with
- [00:23:43.760 -> 00:23:48.480] an idea generator slip box or the main
- [00:23:46.039 -> 00:23:50.360] slip box so let's just sort these
- [00:23:48.480 -> 00:23:52.080] different Primitives fleeting notes fit
- [00:23:50.360 -> 00:23:54.000] under the reference manager slip box
- [00:23:52.080 -> 00:23:56.159] because they're notes that we take as we
- [00:23:54.000 -> 00:23:57.960] read sources so as you're reading a book
- [00:23:56.159 -> 00:24:00.279] perhaps you write down quotes you write
- [00:23:57.960 -> 00:24:02.159] down key insights that you've pulled out
- [00:24:00.279 -> 00:24:03.760] of the source material you've watched a
- [00:24:02.159 -> 00:24:05.400] YouTube video and a quote jumps out at
- [00:24:03.760 -> 00:24:06.880] you or a thought jumps out at you and
- [00:24:05.400 -> 00:24:08.400] you quickly jot that down under a
- [00:24:06.880 -> 00:24:10.760] fleeting note and as a part of that
- [00:24:08.400 -> 00:24:12.720] fleeting note you keep track of where it
- [00:24:10.760 -> 00:24:14.440] came from using a bibliographic note
- [00:24:12.720 -> 00:24:16.240] like a citation so this could be the
- [00:24:14.440 -> 00:24:18.640] name of the book the author of the book
- [00:24:16.240 -> 00:24:20.360] and it is an easy way for you to go back
- [00:24:18.640 -> 00:24:22.440] and tie this to your fleeing note so you
- [00:24:20.360 -> 00:24:24.279] know where that quote came from then you
- [00:24:22.440 -> 00:24:26.600] go through and you extract literature
- [00:24:24.279 -> 00:24:30.000] notes which are key insights Atomic
- [00:24:26.600 -> 00:24:31.679] notes key ideas singular Concepts so in
- [00:24:30.000 -> 00:24:33.919] a sense we have both fleeting notes and
- [00:24:31.679 -> 00:24:35.760] bibliographic notes and they go together
- [00:24:33.919 -> 00:24:37.000] then afterwards you go back and you
- [00:24:35.760 -> 00:24:39.520] review your fleeing notes in your
- [00:24:37.000 -> 00:24:41.880] bibliographic notes and you extract key
- [00:24:39.520 -> 00:24:43.840] insights one by one into their own
- [00:24:41.880 -> 00:24:45.960] independent notes into a literature note
- [00:24:43.840 -> 00:24:48.520] a note that came from literature or from
- [00:24:45.960 -> 00:24:50.679] a video or any other source of
- [00:24:48.520 -> 00:24:53.039] information that you want to be able to
- [00:24:50.679 -> 00:24:54.880] reference the specific place that you
- [00:24:53.039 -> 00:24:56.480] got it from but you don't want to go
- [00:24:54.880 -> 00:24:58.440] back and reread all of your fleeing
- [00:24:56.480 -> 00:25:00.279] notes you want to distill and condense
- [00:24:58.440 -> 00:25:02.000] it into your Atomic noes into your
- [00:25:00.279 -> 00:25:04.159] literature noes then we get to the idea
- [00:25:02.000 -> 00:25:05.840] generator slip box and this is where you
- [00:25:04.159 -> 00:25:07.720] take the literature noes and you review
- [00:25:05.840 -> 00:25:09.440] them and you add them into your
- [00:25:07.720 -> 00:25:13.120] permanent node selection this could
- [00:25:09.440 -> 00:25:16.000] involve linked Concepts ideas thoughts
- [00:25:13.120 -> 00:25:18.240] plus Source material which in this case
- [00:25:16.000 -> 00:25:20.240] are literature nodes to help keep these
- [00:25:18.240 -> 00:25:22.720] in mind and to use this as a way to map
- [00:25:20.240 -> 00:25:26.279] to my molecular node system I'm going to
- [00:25:22.720 -> 00:25:26.279] color code them
- [00:25:28.960 -> 00:25:33.279] and then the whole point of using this
- [00:25:31.039 -> 00:25:35.600] type of notetaking system is that we
- [00:25:33.279 -> 00:25:38.279] have a goal of publication we're writing
- [00:25:35.600 -> 00:25:39.919] for print so we want to take the key
- [00:25:38.279 -> 00:25:42.200] insights the distillations that we've
- [00:25:39.919 -> 00:25:44.279] added into our idea generator slip box
- [00:25:42.200 -> 00:25:46.120] and we want to take that and express it
- [00:25:44.279 -> 00:25:47.559] in some form of publication as we come
- [00:25:46.120 -> 00:25:49.200] across new sources we take fleeting
- [00:25:47.559 -> 00:25:51.440] notes and track where we got the notes
- [00:25:49.200 -> 00:25:54.360] from we go back and review those notes
- [00:25:51.440 -> 00:25:56.720] and extract key ideas singular Concepts
- [00:25:54.360 -> 00:25:58.679] in atomic notes or literature notes and
- [00:25:56.720 -> 00:26:01.000] then we go back and review those Atomic
- [00:25:58.679 -> 00:26:03.279] notes and Link them together and add our
- [00:26:01.000 -> 00:26:05.440] own thoughts and ideas to create a
- [00:26:03.279 -> 00:26:08.000] permanent note something that we are
- [00:26:05.440 -> 00:26:10.360] writing in a format that is designed for
- [00:26:08.000 -> 00:26:12.559] expression designed to be shared so that
- [00:26:10.360 -> 00:26:14.840] we can combine multiple permanent notes
- [00:26:12.559 -> 00:26:17.120] in a note sequence and then publish it
- [00:26:14.840 -> 00:26:19.000] for print that's a quick overview of the
- [00:26:17.120 -> 00:26:20.919] zle Casten system if we quickly compare
- [00:26:19.000 -> 00:26:22.360] that to code we have a capture system
- [00:26:20.919 -> 00:26:25.120] with fleeting notes where we jot down
- [00:26:22.360 -> 00:26:27.440] new information ideas and information
- [00:26:25.120 -> 00:26:29.200] that we get from Source material we
- [00:26:27.440 -> 00:26:30.640] organize it by by putting it into a
- [00:26:29.200 -> 00:26:32.600] system that keeps track of the
- [00:26:30.640 -> 00:26:34.679] information with bibliographic notes and
- [00:26:32.600 -> 00:26:36.720] then we distill the key elements into
- [00:26:34.679 -> 00:26:38.200] literature notes and then Express them
- [00:26:36.720 -> 00:26:40.000] into permanent notes which form the
- [00:26:38.200 -> 00:26:41.960] basis for true expression the public
- [00:26:40.000 -> 00:26:43.640] expression which is print now let's
- [00:26:41.960 -> 00:26:45.559] apply this to my system which has a
- [00:26:43.640 -> 00:26:47.760] couple more Primitives I also have
- [00:26:45.559 -> 00:26:50.799] fleeting notes as part of my system I
- [00:26:47.760 -> 00:26:53.399] have Source notes I have topic notes
- [00:26:50.799 -> 00:26:57.320] project notes atoms which are literature
- [00:26:53.399 -> 00:27:00.760] notes and molecules which are permanent
- [00:26:57.320 -> 00:27:03.640] notes and finally I have Alloys which
- [00:27:00.760 -> 00:27:05.399] are publishable not in my system as well
- [00:27:03.640 -> 00:27:07.240] I have two different organization
- [00:27:05.399 -> 00:27:09.760] methods I use these two different slip
- [00:27:07.240 -> 00:27:11.279] boox styles from the zle Casten system I
- [00:27:09.760 -> 00:27:13.480] just adapt it to be a little more
- [00:27:11.279 -> 00:27:16.720] practical for a digital ecosystem since
- [00:27:13.480 -> 00:27:18.760] again zcast was designed for physical so
- [00:27:16.720 -> 00:27:20.760] I'm going to keep the red color to match
- [00:27:18.760 -> 00:27:22.679] the reference manager and for myself
- [00:27:20.760 -> 00:27:24.399] rather than just having a single box
- [00:27:22.679 -> 00:27:26.320] where I SAR all of my permanent notes
- [00:27:24.399 -> 00:27:29.480] without an indication on how they relate
- [00:27:26.320 -> 00:27:31.640] to other notes by topic I use specific
- [00:27:29.480 -> 00:27:34.520] topic notes to keep better track of this
- [00:27:31.640 -> 00:27:36.240] so I'll make that orange and I also use
- [00:27:34.520 -> 00:27:38.559] project notes as a place to keep track
- [00:27:36.240 -> 00:27:41.600] of my goals because one of the best ways
- [00:27:38.559 -> 00:27:44.000] to use a writing system like this is to
- [00:27:41.600 -> 00:27:46.519] have an idea or a question or a goal in
- [00:27:44.000 -> 00:27:49.360] mind and then use your existing
- [00:27:46.519 -> 00:27:51.080] reference manager system to identify key
- [00:27:49.360 -> 00:27:53.760] insights that can be applied to the
- [00:27:51.080 -> 00:27:55.159] project and by tying specific Concepts
- [00:27:53.760 -> 00:27:57.279] to your project you can produce
- [00:27:55.159 -> 00:27:59.559] permanent noes because you're making it
- [00:27:57.279 -> 00:28:01.480] real and applicable fre you specifically
- [00:27:59.559 -> 00:28:03.840] for myself a fleeting note can be a
- [00:28:01.480 -> 00:28:05.600] source note but it can also be a daily
- [00:28:03.840 -> 00:28:07.159] note so let's add that in here my
- [00:28:05.600 -> 00:28:09.480] fleeting notes come in two different
- [00:28:07.159 -> 00:28:11.840] categories and both of these are capture
- [00:28:09.480 -> 00:28:13.480] methods the C and code then after going
- [00:28:11.840 -> 00:28:15.880] through my fleeting notes I extract the
- [00:28:13.480 -> 00:28:17.399] key insights into atoms which are the
- [00:28:15.880 -> 00:28:20.880] equivalent of literature notes in the
- [00:28:17.399 -> 00:28:23.480] zoc Casten system and I apply topics to
- [00:28:20.880 -> 00:28:25.559] my Atomic notes to my atom notes then I
- [00:28:23.480 -> 00:28:27.720] go through and I pull out the key
- [00:28:25.559 -> 00:28:29.919] insights that have derived in the atoms
- [00:28:27.720 -> 00:28:32.399] then inside of my source notes I also
- [00:28:29.919 -> 00:28:34.640] include fleeting notes so for example if
- [00:28:32.399 -> 00:28:36.960] I'm writing down a quote I might take a
- [00:28:34.640 -> 00:28:38.600] note alongside that quote so in that
- [00:28:36.960 -> 00:28:40.720] case it's not necessarily a fleeting
- [00:28:38.600 -> 00:28:42.360] note as it relates specifically to an
- [00:28:40.720 -> 00:28:44.080] atomic note as part of the reference
- [00:28:42.360 -> 00:28:46.360] manager system but it's actually a
- [00:28:44.080 -> 00:28:48.640] thought or idea so sometimes my fleeting
- [00:28:46.360 -> 00:28:50.720] notes actually directly go into my
- [00:28:48.640 -> 00:28:53.120] molecular notes as well I'll show you in
- [00:28:50.720 -> 00:28:54.519] a little bit how I actually structure
- [00:28:53.120 -> 00:28:56.360] this inside of my source notes when we
- [00:28:54.519 -> 00:28:57.679] get into the templating section and
- [00:28:56.360 -> 00:28:59.200] it'll make a little more sense there
- [00:28:57.679 -> 00:29:02.120] once we got go through and we've built
- [00:28:59.200 -> 00:29:03.919] up a an idea generation slip box in the
- [00:29:02.120 -> 00:29:06.000] molecules I go through and I combine
- [00:29:03.919 -> 00:29:08.200] them and I publish them so these publish
- [00:29:06.000 -> 00:29:10.760] notes could be a newsletter could be a
- [00:29:08.200 -> 00:29:12.279] YouTube video could be my digital garden
- [00:29:10.760 -> 00:29:14.320] and again I'll get into that in a little
- [00:29:12.279 -> 00:29:16.279] bit so you can see how this system is
- [00:29:14.320 -> 00:29:19.200] actually quite similar but I've just
- [00:29:16.279 -> 00:29:21.519] included a couple subn notes like these
- [00:29:19.200 -> 00:29:23.600] daily notes and Source notes and project
- [00:29:21.519 -> 00:29:26.279] notes that produce fleeting notes that
- [00:29:23.600 -> 00:29:27.799] then can be used as both inspiration for
- [00:29:26.279 -> 00:29:29.720] the atoms the literature notes that I'm
- [00:29:27.799 -> 00:29:31.760] pulling out of my sources and the
- [00:29:29.720 -> 00:29:33.760] molecular notes the permanent notes of
- [00:29:31.760 -> 00:29:35.320] my key ideas and how they actually apply
- [00:29:33.760 -> 00:29:37.000] to the literature notes that I'm
- [00:29:35.320 -> 00:29:38.480] extracting from the sources to help you
- [00:29:37.000 -> 00:29:39.799] see this a little bit better let's go
- [00:29:38.480 -> 00:29:41.480] back to that graphic I showed you at the
- [00:29:39.799 -> 00:29:43.399] beginning of code and how this all ties
- [00:29:41.480 -> 00:29:45.120] together and then I'll get into the
- [00:29:43.399 -> 00:29:47.279] templates that I use for each of these
- [00:29:45.120 -> 00:29:48.760] note types to help speed up my system
- [00:29:47.279 -> 00:29:50.240] okay so now I hope that you've seen a
- [00:29:48.760 -> 00:29:52.080] little bit better how these different
- [00:29:50.240 -> 00:29:54.399] concepts fit into the buckets of capture
- [00:29:52.080 -> 00:29:56.039] organized distill and express so we have
- [00:29:54.399 -> 00:29:57.679] daily notes and Source notes which are a
- [00:29:56.039 -> 00:29:59.720] form of fleeting notes and also the
- [00:29:57.679 -> 00:30:02.000] source notes tied to a bibliographic
- [00:29:59.720 -> 00:30:03.880] reference a citation we use topics for
- [00:30:02.000 -> 00:30:05.360] structure again I'll get into that later
- [00:30:03.880 -> 00:30:07.320] and then we have a distillation
- [00:30:05.360 -> 00:30:09.720] component where we distill The Source
- [00:30:07.320 -> 00:30:12.720] material into atoms and then use that
- [00:30:09.720 -> 00:30:15.200] distillation to apply our own ideas and
- [00:30:12.720 -> 00:30:17.159] thoughts plus the atom to create a
- [00:30:15.200 -> 00:30:19.360] molecule to create a combination of
- [00:30:17.159 -> 00:30:22.159] multiple Concepts together that form a
- [00:30:19.360 -> 00:30:24.320] permanent part of my collection of my
- [00:30:22.159 -> 00:30:26.960] main slip box my idea generation slip
- [00:30:24.320 -> 00:30:28.320] box then I use these molecules which are
- [00:30:26.960 -> 00:30:30.960] tied back to the citation to The
- [00:30:28.320 -> 00:30:33.200] credibility of the atoms and I can write
- [00:30:30.960 -> 00:30:35.000] and express these ideas or create
- [00:30:33.200 -> 00:30:37.279] YouTube videos for them so to show a
- [00:30:35.000 -> 00:30:38.840] quick workflow I could read my book I
- [00:30:37.279 -> 00:30:41.120] could take notes on my books and extract
- [00:30:38.840 -> 00:30:42.760] quotes I can tag those quotes with a
- [00:30:41.120 -> 00:30:44.159] particular topic that helps me
- [00:30:42.760 -> 00:30:46.480] understand structure and then I can
- [00:30:44.159 -> 00:30:49.399] extract I can distill the literature
- [00:30:46.480 -> 00:30:50.880] notes as atoms and as molecules from a
- [00:30:49.399 -> 00:30:53.480] combination of these fleeting notes and
- [00:30:50.880 -> 00:30:55.200] atomic notes and use those based on my
- [00:30:53.480 -> 00:30:57.039] projects and my questions and my ideas
- [00:30:55.200 -> 00:30:58.679] the things that I'm pursuing with this
- [00:30:57.039 -> 00:31:00.480] research to produce something in a
- [00:30:58.679 -> 00:31:02.559] publishable format okay so now that
- [00:31:00.480 -> 00:31:05.120] you've seen a little bit more about Z
- [00:31:02.559 -> 00:31:06.360] Casten you might feel a bit confused I
- [00:31:05.120 -> 00:31:08.519] know I did when I first started
- [00:31:06.360 -> 00:31:10.000] researching this I found that it was
- [00:31:08.519 -> 00:31:12.399] very helpful to actually take a step
- [00:31:10.000 -> 00:31:14.320] back and look at the goals of why I was
- [00:31:12.399 -> 00:31:16.000] trying to build a system like zle Casten
- [00:31:14.320 -> 00:31:17.919] and why it appealed to me in the first
- [00:31:16.000 -> 00:31:20.120] place by looking at these goals and
- [00:31:17.919 -> 00:31:21.760] listing them out I was then able to map
- [00:31:20.120 -> 00:31:24.320] what it was I was trying to do in a
- [00:31:21.760 -> 00:31:26.159] practical way in my obsidian so that my
- [00:31:24.320 -> 00:31:28.080] notetaking system really took off and
- [00:31:26.159 -> 00:31:29.679] became a lot more valuable for me so
- [00:31:28.080 -> 00:31:31.519] here are some of the common goals that I
- [00:31:29.679 -> 00:31:33.039] keep in mind when structuring my note
- [00:31:31.519 -> 00:31:34.679] taking system one of the things I've
- [00:31:33.039 -> 00:31:36.000] realized is that each person has
- [00:31:34.679 -> 00:31:38.080] different goals in mind they have
- [00:31:36.000 -> 00:31:40.840] different things that they want to
- [00:31:38.080 -> 00:31:42.080] achieve with their note taking system so
- [00:31:40.840 -> 00:31:44.320] that makes it really hard to come up
- [00:31:42.080 -> 00:31:46.480] with a one- siiz fits-all solution so if
- [00:31:44.320 -> 00:31:49.000] you can keep in mind your specific goals
- [00:31:46.480 -> 00:31:50.600] as you go through and as you watch me
- [00:31:49.000 -> 00:31:53.639] create this note taking system this
- [00:31:50.600 -> 00:31:56.320] molecular zle Casten it'll help you have
- [00:31:53.639 -> 00:31:57.639] an emotional connection to this system
- [00:31:56.320 -> 00:31:59.799] because you'll be able to see how can
- [00:31:57.639 -> 00:32:01.760] actually practically be used in your own
- [00:31:59.799 -> 00:32:03.399] life and if you can see how it can be
- [00:32:01.760 -> 00:32:05.080] used in your own life as a practical
- [00:32:03.399 -> 00:32:06.679] purpose all of the sudden the system
- [00:32:05.080 -> 00:32:08.240] starts to make a lot more sense it's
- [00:32:06.679 -> 00:32:10.080] hard to deal with in the abstract it's
- [00:32:08.240 -> 00:32:12.080] something that you just have to
- [00:32:10.080 -> 00:32:13.519] understand by doing so with that in mind
- [00:32:12.080 -> 00:32:15.480] I want to share a quote the quote is
- [00:32:13.519 -> 00:32:17.679] from Richard Fineman and it's notes
- [00:32:15.480 -> 00:32:20.080] aren't a record of my thinking process
- [00:32:17.679 -> 00:32:21.639] they are my thinking process the zcast
- [00:32:20.080 -> 00:32:25.000] and system will start to make a lot more
- [00:32:21.639 -> 00:32:28.279] sense if you start to think inside the
- [00:32:25.000 -> 00:32:31.080] box if you use this system as an act ual
- [00:32:28.279 -> 00:32:33.080] thinking box rather than going to the
- [00:32:31.080 -> 00:32:35.120] internet to go look for new information
- [00:32:33.080 -> 00:32:36.840] I can instead go to my permanent notes
- [00:32:35.120 -> 00:32:38.799] my molecules and look through the
- [00:32:36.840 -> 00:32:40.279] information that I've already distilled
- [00:32:38.799 -> 00:32:42.399] this is knowledge that I've already
- [00:32:40.279 -> 00:32:44.279] included inside of my system and it
- [00:32:42.399 -> 00:32:46.240] becomes a lot easier to process it
- [00:32:44.279 -> 00:32:48.200] because I'm not going to get information
- [00:32:46.240 -> 00:32:50.080] overload since it's not information at
- [00:32:48.200 -> 00:32:52.399] this point it's actual knowledge the
- [00:32:50.080 -> 00:32:54.480] next goal is to create standardized
- [00:32:52.399 -> 00:32:56.760] system the thinking box you can think of
- [00:32:54.480 -> 00:32:59.159] this as Lego for your thoughts if you
- [00:32:56.760 -> 00:33:00.679] have a standardized system you have a
- [00:32:59.159 -> 00:33:02.600] system in place that you don't have to
- [00:33:00.679 -> 00:33:03.799] think about that you just go and you
- [00:33:02.600 -> 00:33:06.360] know that you can fit all the different
- [00:33:03.799 -> 00:33:09.320] pieces together you can truly have
- [00:33:06.360 -> 00:33:10.880] Atomic notes that you can plug together
- [00:33:09.320 -> 00:33:12.960] in any different way to build whatever
- [00:33:10.880 -> 00:33:15.320] it is you want by standardizing the
- [00:33:12.960 -> 00:33:17.919] system up front you can save a ton of
- [00:33:15.320 -> 00:33:18.960] time in actually using your system
- [00:33:17.919 -> 00:33:20.919] because you don't have to think about
- [00:33:18.960 -> 00:33:24.039] where things go you can actually just
- [00:33:20.919 -> 00:33:25.880] focus instead on your ideas and your
- [00:33:24.039 -> 00:33:27.320] understanding and looking for insights
- [00:33:25.880 -> 00:33:29.200] rather than oh where should I put this
- [00:33:27.320 -> 00:33:30.880] note where should I organize this the
- [00:33:29.200 -> 00:33:32.600] next goal is to solve the blank page
- [00:33:30.880 -> 00:33:34.480] problem which is another way of saying
- [00:33:32.600 -> 00:33:36.000] never start from scratch because once
- [00:33:34.480 -> 00:33:37.799] you've gone through and you've created
- [00:33:36.000 -> 00:33:39.919] your Lego blocks you've created your
- [00:33:37.799 -> 00:33:42.000] Atomic notes you begin building up your
- [00:33:39.919 -> 00:33:43.760] molecular system of your permanent notes
- [00:33:42.000 -> 00:33:45.840] you'll have hundreds or thousands of
- [00:33:43.760 -> 00:33:47.159] pieces that you can use and put together
- [00:33:45.840 -> 00:33:49.279] in any different combination that you
- [00:33:47.159 -> 00:33:51.760] want to you can think of it as you have
- [00:33:49.279 -> 00:33:53.200] an idea a new project comes to mind and
- [00:33:51.760 -> 00:33:55.240] that's kind of like the instructions of
- [00:33:53.200 -> 00:33:57.360] a Lego kit and you can use the same
- [00:33:55.240 -> 00:33:59.639] pieces in a Lego kit to build a castle
- [00:33:57.360 -> 00:34:00.919] or a house or a boat you can build
- [00:33:59.639 -> 00:34:03.200] whatever it is you want and you can
- [00:34:00.919 -> 00:34:05.320] reuse the pieces so rather than starting
- [00:34:03.200 -> 00:34:07.080] from scratch inside of your thinking box
- [00:34:05.320 -> 00:34:08.919] you can go back and reuse your atoms and
- [00:34:07.080 -> 00:34:10.919] your molecules your literature notes and
- [00:34:08.919 -> 00:34:12.919] your permanent notes so that you can
- [00:34:10.919 -> 00:34:15.079] just piece together the ideas in new
- [00:34:12.919 -> 00:34:16.520] ways and that will help you derive new
- [00:34:15.079 -> 00:34:18.560] insights and come up with new things to
- [00:34:16.520 -> 00:34:20.800] publish and the next main goal is to
- [00:34:18.560 -> 00:34:22.440] generate intuitive and organic growth so
- [00:34:20.800 -> 00:34:24.480] the idea here is that as you build up
- [00:34:22.440 -> 00:34:25.960] your box as you build up your notes
- [00:34:24.480 -> 00:34:27.320] you'll eventually start to have an
- [00:34:25.960 -> 00:34:29.520] intuition on how different things
- [00:34:27.320 -> 00:34:31.440] connect together how you can use topics
- [00:34:29.520 -> 00:34:33.919] and how you can use atoms and sources
- [00:34:31.440 -> 00:34:36.240] and molecules to produce the Alloys to
- [00:34:33.919 -> 00:34:37.560] produce the fruit of your work the key
- [00:34:36.240 -> 00:34:40.079] here is that this is something that's
- [00:34:37.560 -> 00:34:41.480] only going to work for you intuition is
- [00:34:40.079 -> 00:34:43.200] not something that you can tell someone
- [00:34:41.480 -> 00:34:45.760] else it's something that you have to do
- [00:34:43.200 -> 00:34:47.079] yourself to develop a personal system
- [00:34:45.760 -> 00:34:49.320] there's a reason that it's called
- [00:34:47.079 -> 00:34:50.720] personal Knowledge Management because
- [00:34:49.320 -> 00:34:52.599] everyone is going to have a slightly
- [00:34:50.720 -> 00:34:54.599] different system that they use to
- [00:34:52.599 -> 00:34:56.679] generate this type of insight so if you
- [00:34:54.599 -> 00:34:58.320] can follow your own intuition and make
- [00:34:56.679 -> 00:35:00.240] connections between them notes then
- [00:34:58.320 -> 00:35:02.800] you'll be able to generate a system that
- [00:35:00.240 -> 00:35:05.920] works uniquely for you and finally a
- [00:35:02.800 -> 00:35:07.400] main goal is to reduce working memory by
- [00:35:05.920 -> 00:35:09.599] offloading all of your thoughts and
- [00:35:07.400 -> 00:35:11.400] ideas and knowledge by introducing
- [00:35:09.599 -> 00:35:13.119] quotes and notes and linking everything
- [00:35:11.400 -> 00:35:14.359] together in a way that you can instantly
- [00:35:13.119 -> 00:35:16.640] go and find whatever it is you're
- [00:35:14.359 -> 00:35:18.920] looking for you can significantly reduce
- [00:35:16.640 -> 00:35:20.680] your working memory as you go to create
- [00:35:18.920 -> 00:35:22.560] new things as you work on original
- [00:35:20.680 -> 00:35:24.480] thinking or work to solve your problems
- [00:35:22.560 -> 00:35:25.960] intuitively by offloading all of this
- [00:35:24.480 -> 00:35:28.359] into your second brain into your
- [00:35:25.960 -> 00:35:29.920] molecular zedcast and system you can
- [00:35:28.359 -> 00:35:31.160] take all of the energy that you normally
- [00:35:29.920 -> 00:35:33.880] would have taken trying to remember
- [00:35:31.160 -> 00:35:36.000] things and instead apply that to New
- [00:35:33.880 -> 00:35:37.720] Creations and understanding once I
- [00:35:36.000 -> 00:35:39.400] understood my own goals better for note
- [00:35:37.720 -> 00:35:41.320] taking to be honest I was still a little
- [00:35:39.400 -> 00:35:43.720] confused at the value of zle Casten and
- [00:35:41.320 -> 00:35:45.400] how I could practically implement it so
- [00:35:43.720 -> 00:35:47.400] I decided to do some research into
- [00:35:45.400 -> 00:35:49.960] personal Knowledge Management Theory or
- [00:35:47.400 -> 00:35:51.720] the study of knowledge epistemology by
- [00:35:49.960 -> 00:35:53.440] looking at some of the main theories of
- [00:35:51.720 -> 00:35:55.280] knowledge and how that fits into modern
- [00:35:53.440 -> 00:35:57.920] Knowledge Management I was much better
- [00:35:55.280 -> 00:35:59.880] able to map the zle cast and system to
- [00:35:57.920 -> 00:36:02.079] what made sense for me in a practical
- [00:35:59.880 -> 00:36:04.160] sense as part of my molecular notetaking
- [00:36:02.079 -> 00:36:05.800] system let's take a look at a few of the
- [00:36:04.160 -> 00:36:07.800] common theories that I personally found
- [00:36:05.800 -> 00:36:09.440] to be the most valuable I want to walk
- [00:36:07.800 -> 00:36:11.760] through a couple different Graphics that
- [00:36:09.440 -> 00:36:13.319] I personally find very helpful that I
- [00:36:11.760 -> 00:36:15.800] hope will make these Concepts a little
- [00:36:13.319 -> 00:36:18.079] more concrete and less abstract to show
- [00:36:15.800 -> 00:36:19.920] you how information can actually be
- [00:36:18.079 -> 00:36:21.880] converted into knowledge and knowledge
- [00:36:19.920 -> 00:36:24.160] can be converted into wisdom and then
- [00:36:21.880 -> 00:36:26.000] wisdom can be applied based on insights
- [00:36:24.160 -> 00:36:28.560] that you're deriving through the use of
- [00:36:26.000 -> 00:36:29.599] your thinking box your zle system let's
- [00:36:28.560 -> 00:36:31.200] take a look at one of my favorite
- [00:36:29.599 -> 00:36:35.200] Graphics this is called the data
- [00:36:31.200 -> 00:36:36.760] information knowledge wisdom chart or in
- [00:36:35.200 -> 00:36:38.880] this case it goes a little bit deeper
- [00:36:36.760 -> 00:36:41.240] into insights and impact but the idea
- [00:36:38.880 -> 00:36:42.839] here is that we start off with data and
- [00:36:41.240 -> 00:36:45.680] data is something like the name of a
- [00:36:42.839 -> 00:36:47.000] book or an author it's a note that we've
- [00:36:45.680 -> 00:36:49.119] created but it doesn't have any
- [00:36:47.000 -> 00:36:50.599] information in it it's just a blank note
- [00:36:49.119 -> 00:36:53.520] this could be considered like a ghost
- [00:36:50.599 -> 00:36:55.319] note for example if I were to go to one
- [00:36:53.520 -> 00:36:56.960] of my existing notes like the code note
- [00:36:55.319 -> 00:36:59.560] and I wanted to create a new note called
- [00:36:56.960 -> 00:37:00.760] Data information knowledge wisdom you
- [00:36:59.560 -> 00:37:02.800] can see here that there's a difference
- [00:37:00.760 -> 00:37:04.640] in the color this emergent structure is
- [00:37:02.800 -> 00:37:07.000] a note that I have already written in
- [00:37:04.640 -> 00:37:08.560] but this data Insight knowledge wisdom
- [00:37:07.000 -> 00:37:10.200] note is a ghost note it's one that
- [00:37:08.560 -> 00:37:12.240] doesn't have any information in it it's
- [00:37:10.200 -> 00:37:14.440] kind of like this data point where it's
- [00:37:12.240 -> 00:37:17.079] a blank note that doesn't have any color
- [00:37:14.440 -> 00:37:19.119] and if we look here at the local graph
- [00:37:17.079 -> 00:37:21.079] you can see here that the emergent
- [00:37:19.119 -> 00:37:22.880] structure note is filled in it looks
- [00:37:21.079 -> 00:37:25.359] more like one of these information dots
- [00:37:22.880 -> 00:37:27.560] than the data information knowledge
- [00:37:25.359 -> 00:37:29.319] wisdom note which is just a grade out
- [00:37:27.560 -> 00:37:31.200] note a ghost note so I think this is
- [00:37:29.319 -> 00:37:33.079] actually where obsidian when you start
- [00:37:31.200 -> 00:37:35.160] to compare the knowledge graph on how
- [00:37:33.079 -> 00:37:37.200] you can use obsidian to this type of
- [00:37:35.160 -> 00:37:39.560] graph here you can really start to
- [00:37:37.200 -> 00:37:41.480] understand the concrete nature of
- [00:37:39.560 -> 00:37:43.480] forging Knowledge from information by
- [00:37:41.480 -> 00:37:45.160] making connections between dots now if
- [00:37:43.480 -> 00:37:47.920] we go back to the graph here once we've
- [00:37:45.160 -> 00:37:50.359] gone through our sources and we've
- [00:37:47.920 -> 00:37:52.839] pulled out quotes and we've added notes
- [00:37:50.359 -> 00:37:55.079] we've effectively taken that empty data
- [00:37:52.839 -> 00:37:56.839] point and we've added information to it
- [00:37:55.079 -> 00:37:59.240] we've filled it with something when we
- [00:37:56.839 -> 00:38:01.359] go through and we extract information
- [00:37:59.240 -> 00:38:03.359] from the source into a literature note
- [00:38:01.359 -> 00:38:05.079] which I'm calling an atom we now have a
- [00:38:03.359 -> 00:38:07.319] piece of information that came from an
- [00:38:05.079 -> 00:38:08.960] external Source the more atoms you build
- [00:38:07.319 -> 00:38:10.520] in here sure they might be connected to
- [00:38:08.960 -> 00:38:12.440] a source but they're not connected to
- [00:38:10.520 -> 00:38:14.720] each other because it's just a singular
- [00:38:12.440 -> 00:38:16.599] concept the connection is where the
- [00:38:14.720 -> 00:38:18.160] ideas really start to shine and that's
- [00:38:16.599 -> 00:38:19.280] where we start to get into knowledge you
- [00:38:18.160 -> 00:38:21.200] can see here that the different
- [00:38:19.280 -> 00:38:23.240] information dots we have now are linked
- [00:38:21.200 -> 00:38:25.000] by lines which is exactly like the
- [00:38:23.240 -> 00:38:26.160] knowledge graph in obsidian you can see
- [00:38:25.000 -> 00:38:28.000] here that we've got pieces of
- [00:38:26.160 -> 00:38:30.000] information singular notes that have
- [00:38:28.000 -> 00:38:32.200] been connected to one another to form
- [00:38:30.000 -> 00:38:34.280] linkages and again this is how you
- [00:38:32.200 -> 00:38:36.839] introduce Knowledge from information if
- [00:38:34.280 -> 00:38:38.800] you take a single quote from a source
- [00:38:36.839 -> 00:38:41.040] you turned it into some form of atom and
- [00:38:38.800 -> 00:38:42.480] then you link multiple quotes together
- [00:38:41.040 -> 00:38:43.880] now all of the sudden you're starting to
- [00:38:42.480 -> 00:38:46.880] get into knowledge because you're
- [00:38:43.880 -> 00:38:49.160] applying that information that applied
- [00:38:46.880 -> 00:38:51.599] information that connected information
- [00:38:49.160 -> 00:38:54.640] is like taking the atoms and adding your
- [00:38:51.599 -> 00:38:56.560] own ideas or thoughts or insights and
- [00:38:54.640 -> 00:38:58.599] you link them together you bridge
- [00:38:56.560 -> 00:39:01.000] Concepts together this is what I call a
- [00:38:58.599 -> 00:39:03.040] molecule or in zle Casten this would be
- [00:39:01.000 -> 00:39:05.960] a permanent note so once you've begun
- [00:39:03.040 -> 00:39:08.280] creating your idea generator slip box
- [00:39:05.960 -> 00:39:09.880] your thinking box you can then go back
- [00:39:08.280 -> 00:39:11.800] through and you can just take a look at
- [00:39:09.880 -> 00:39:13.880] the knowledge that you already have
- [00:39:11.800 -> 00:39:15.720] consumed it's something that is a lot
- [00:39:13.880 -> 00:39:17.880] harder to feel overwhelmed with because
- [00:39:15.720 -> 00:39:19.400] it's knowledge not information so as you
- [00:39:17.880 -> 00:39:21.200] go through this knowledge when you're
- [00:39:19.400 -> 00:39:23.960] looking through your slip box your main
- [00:39:21.200 -> 00:39:26.280] slip box you might begin to identify
- [00:39:23.960 -> 00:39:28.200] insights and these are usually derived
- [00:39:26.280 -> 00:39:29.839] from your projects where you might have
- [00:39:28.200 -> 00:39:32.920] a question or a problem that you're
- [00:39:29.839 -> 00:39:35.440] trying to solve and this problem or this
- [00:39:32.920 -> 00:39:37.160] question can operate as a guide that can
- [00:39:35.440 -> 00:39:39.319] lead you towards insights which are
- [00:39:37.160 -> 00:39:41.319] unexpected connections it's where you
- [00:39:39.319 -> 00:39:42.880] take the context and you apply it to
- [00:39:41.319 -> 00:39:44.560] your knowledge and you start to realize
- [00:39:42.880 -> 00:39:46.319] like oh perhaps these two notes are
- [00:39:44.560 -> 00:39:48.280] actually related to each other let me
- [00:39:46.319 -> 00:39:50.760] see if I can make a connection let me
- [00:39:48.280 -> 00:39:52.520] see if I can follow the path to get from
- [00:39:50.760 -> 00:39:54.400] one note to another and then produce
- [00:39:52.520 -> 00:39:55.960] this Insight between them and that's
- [00:39:54.400 -> 00:39:57.440] what's called wisdom because you're
- [00:39:55.960 -> 00:39:59.599] taking knowledge and you're actually
- [00:39:57.440 -> 00:40:02.079] applying it to your life that's what
- [00:39:59.599 -> 00:40:04.680] wisdom is it's when you take something
- [00:40:02.079 -> 00:40:06.640] that is applicable in one situation and
- [00:40:04.680 -> 00:40:08.880] you use that knowledge and apply it in
- [00:40:06.640 -> 00:40:10.560] another situation and by doing so the
- [00:40:08.880 -> 00:40:12.960] more you begin to develop wisdom the
- [00:40:10.560 -> 00:40:14.359] greater impact you have and this impact
- [00:40:12.960 -> 00:40:16.400] it can be published it can be something
- [00:40:14.359 -> 00:40:18.319] that's shared so not only is this wisdom
- [00:40:16.400 -> 00:40:19.920] having an impact on your own life but
- [00:40:18.319 -> 00:40:22.319] it's also having an impact on someone
- [00:40:19.920 -> 00:40:24.720] else's life we can take these external
- [00:40:22.319 -> 00:40:27.359] data points we can convert them into
- [00:40:24.720 -> 00:40:29.760] information and then we can link that
- [00:40:27.359 -> 00:40:32.280] information together into our own
- [00:40:29.760 -> 00:40:34.280] internal system to create molecules or
- [00:40:32.280 -> 00:40:36.240] permanent nodes and then apply those
- [00:40:34.280 -> 00:40:38.160] molecules to our problems in our
- [00:40:36.240 -> 00:40:40.280] projects in our life to generate
- [00:40:38.160 -> 00:40:42.800] insights that can produce wisdom that
- [00:40:40.280 -> 00:40:44.520] help us publish information publish that
- [00:40:42.800 -> 00:40:46.680] knowledge in a way that it's information
- [00:40:44.520 -> 00:40:48.640] for other people so it ends up becoming
- [00:40:46.680 -> 00:40:50.720] a source and we end up having this nice
- [00:40:48.640 -> 00:40:51.920] little circle it's a great feedback loop
- [00:40:50.720 -> 00:40:53.680] this is what's called a personal
- [00:40:51.920 -> 00:40:56.000] Knowledge Management System here so I
- [00:40:53.680 -> 00:40:58.319] seek I go and I try and derive
- [00:40:56.000 -> 00:41:00.480] information from sources I make sense of
- [00:40:58.319 -> 00:41:03.000] it by processing it distilling it into
- [00:41:00.480 -> 00:41:05.400] atoms and molecules and then I share
- [00:41:03.000 -> 00:41:07.760] those ideas with my community and that
- [00:41:05.400 -> 00:41:09.760] helps them seek and sense and then we
- [00:41:07.760 -> 00:41:11.640] end up all building together in a very
- [00:41:09.760 -> 00:41:13.760] helpful way this is also known as the
- [00:41:11.640 -> 00:41:16.359] Continuum of understanding where you
- [00:41:13.760 -> 00:41:18.720] gather Parts you collect Concepts like
- [00:41:16.359 -> 00:41:20.640] the data points the blank notes you then
- [00:41:18.720 -> 00:41:22.680] add information to those notes you add
- [00:41:20.640 -> 00:41:24.720] quotes and You Begin connecting them to
- [00:41:22.680 -> 00:41:26.720] form holes which are knowledge and then
- [00:41:24.720 -> 00:41:28.920] you join those holes together to form
- [00:41:26.720 -> 00:41:31.119] wisdom so you look to the Past what
- [00:41:28.920 -> 00:41:33.359] other people have done to produce data
- [00:41:31.119 -> 00:41:35.520] and information and then you take that
- [00:41:33.359 -> 00:41:37.040] information and convert it and process
- [00:41:35.520 -> 00:41:39.079] it into knowledge yourself so that you
- [00:41:37.040 -> 00:41:40.720] can apply it in the future as another
- [00:41:39.079 -> 00:41:43.760] form of that graphic you can see here
- [00:41:40.720 -> 00:41:45.880] that we can take data we can process
- [00:41:43.760 -> 00:41:47.760] that data into information by asking
- [00:41:45.880 -> 00:41:49.920] questions and organizing it to describe
- [00:41:47.760 -> 00:41:52.160] who what where and when then we can take
- [00:41:49.920 -> 00:41:53.599] that information and we can apply Theory
- [00:41:52.160 -> 00:41:55.200] to it which is a framework that we're
- [00:41:53.599 -> 00:41:56.960] getting from someone else from a book
- [00:41:55.200 -> 00:41:58.839] for example and then as we go through
- [00:41:56.960 -> 00:42:01.000] and we actually experience that theory
- [00:41:58.839 -> 00:42:02.920] ourselves we can combine our own
- [00:42:01.000 -> 00:42:04.240] experience with that theory to produce
- [00:42:02.920 -> 00:42:06.040] knowledge which is the collective
- [00:42:04.240 -> 00:42:08.480] information that is actually relevant to
- [00:42:06.040 -> 00:42:10.520] our lives as we go through and look at
- [00:42:08.480 -> 00:42:12.440] that knowledge we can process it and we
- [00:42:10.520 -> 00:42:14.400] can begin to generate other
- [00:42:12.440 -> 00:42:16.160] understanding we can derive insights on
- [00:42:14.400 -> 00:42:18.000] how it's actually applicable to our own
- [00:42:16.160 -> 00:42:20.520] lives and then we can use that
- [00:42:18.000 -> 00:42:23.520] applicable knowledge to produce wisdom
- [00:42:20.520 -> 00:42:25.359] which is where we actually try to apply
- [00:42:23.520 -> 00:42:27.680] that knowledge to the Future so that we
- [00:42:25.359 -> 00:42:29.760] can do what works best for us you can
- [00:42:27.680 -> 00:42:32.280] see here it's also split again into
- [00:42:29.760 -> 00:42:33.880] extrinsic and intrinsic so the data and
- [00:42:32.280 -> 00:42:35.920] the information comes from external
- [00:42:33.880 -> 00:42:38.520] sources but the knowledge and
- [00:42:35.920 -> 00:42:40.200] understanding is from an internal source
- [00:42:38.520 -> 00:42:41.920] and then we apply that through wisdom
- [00:42:40.200 -> 00:42:43.599] which becomes an extrinsic source for
- [00:42:41.920 -> 00:42:45.079] someone else and then the final
- [00:42:43.599 -> 00:42:47.319] framework that I wanted to talk about
- [00:42:45.079 -> 00:42:50.319] here is called Bloom's taxonomy so this
- [00:42:47.319 -> 00:42:53.040] is a very well-known method of getting
- [00:42:50.319 -> 00:42:54.280] to original thinking to True creation so
- [00:42:53.040 -> 00:42:56.839] you start at the bottom where you need
- [00:42:54.280 -> 00:42:59.160] to remember information you recall basic
- [00:42:56.839 -> 00:43:01.359] facts and Concepts so you can think of
- [00:42:59.160 -> 00:43:04.480] this like the atoms then you take those
- [00:43:01.359 -> 00:43:07.040] atoms and you use your own words to
- [00:43:04.480 -> 00:43:08.800] explain them this is where you take that
- [00:43:07.040 -> 00:43:10.839] information and you convert it into
- [00:43:08.800 -> 00:43:12.480] knowledge you begin to understand what
- [00:43:10.839 -> 00:43:14.440] the concepts are because they actually
- [00:43:12.480 -> 00:43:16.680] have an applicability to your own life
- [00:43:14.440 -> 00:43:18.800] you can then apply that knowledge that
- [00:43:16.680 -> 00:43:20.920] understanding in new situations which is
- [00:43:18.800 -> 00:43:22.680] like wisdom because you're taking that
- [00:43:20.920 -> 00:43:24.240] knowledge in making it more practical
- [00:43:22.680 -> 00:43:25.920] the more knowledge you apply and the
- [00:43:24.240 -> 00:43:27.559] more knowledge you accumulate inside of
- [00:43:25.920 -> 00:43:29.680] your thinking box the more you're able
- [00:43:27.559 -> 00:43:31.760] to draw connections between new ideas
- [00:43:29.680 -> 00:43:33.240] and you're able to analyze how the old
- [00:43:31.760 -> 00:43:36.240] knowledge applies to these new
- [00:43:33.240 -> 00:43:38.119] situations you begin to evaluate the
- [00:43:36.240 -> 00:43:40.119] impact of those connections and how this
- [00:43:38.119 -> 00:43:42.319] is changing your life and overall you
- [00:43:40.119 -> 00:43:44.359] end up having an entirely new experience
- [00:43:42.319 -> 00:43:45.640] something that's fairly unique to you
- [00:43:44.359 -> 00:43:48.200] where you're able to go through and
- [00:43:45.640 -> 00:43:50.240] distill all of that remembering
- [00:43:48.200 -> 00:43:53.160] understanding application analysis and
- [00:43:50.240 -> 00:43:55.280] evaluation to truly produce some new or
- [00:43:53.160 -> 00:43:58.319] original work as you can see with Bloom
- [00:43:55.280 -> 00:44:00.400] tonomy the point is to Elevate each type
- [00:43:58.319 -> 00:44:02.079] of thinking until we get to the Apex to
- [00:44:00.400 -> 00:44:04.160] the top of the pyramid which is
- [00:44:02.079 -> 00:44:06.000] originality the whole goal of using
- [00:44:04.160 -> 00:44:08.559] personal Knowledge Management is to help
- [00:44:06.000 -> 00:44:10.880] us make sense of our own ideas and how
- [00:44:08.559 -> 00:44:12.720] it maps to the rest of the world as we
- [00:44:10.880 -> 00:44:14.640] consume information we want to be able
- [00:44:12.720 -> 00:44:17.280] to filter and process it in a way that
- [00:44:14.640 -> 00:44:18.720] it actually has practical value for us I
- [00:44:17.280 -> 00:44:20.319] worked as a patent agent and an
- [00:44:18.720 -> 00:44:22.240] intellectual property lawyer for many
- [00:44:20.319 -> 00:44:24.200] years the whole point of what I was
- [00:44:22.240 -> 00:44:26.280] doing with my job was I would talk to
- [00:44:24.200 -> 00:44:28.040] inventors and engineers and scientists
- [00:44:26.280 -> 00:44:30.200] and I would have teams people discussing
- [00:44:28.040 -> 00:44:32.680] their ideas I would work with them to
- [00:44:30.200 -> 00:44:35.520] help distill the key elements The Core
- [00:44:32.680 -> 00:44:37.119] Concepts of their idea the idea core and
- [00:44:35.520 -> 00:44:39.119] then we would use that idea core to
- [00:44:37.119 -> 00:44:40.960] structure out the rest of the patent the
- [00:44:39.119 -> 00:44:42.960] more you can do this in your own life
- [00:44:40.960 -> 00:44:45.000] the easier it becomes to actually build
- [00:44:42.960 -> 00:44:46.680] on your existing insights and compound
- [00:44:45.000 -> 00:44:49.000] your knowledge because you have it
- [00:44:46.680 -> 00:44:50.599] within the purpose of trying to
- [00:44:49.000 -> 00:44:52.559] structure your system for original
- [00:44:50.599 -> 00:44:54.319] thinking also I recognize that this is a
- [00:44:52.559 -> 00:44:55.800] lot of information but what I'm trying
- [00:44:54.319 -> 00:44:57.599] to do is show you a few different
- [00:44:55.800 -> 00:44:58.960] theories because I never never know what
- [00:44:57.599 -> 00:45:01.200] might resonate with one person or
- [00:44:58.960 -> 00:45:02.760] another hopefully by looking at this
- [00:45:01.200 -> 00:45:04.760] concept of Knowledge Management from
- [00:45:02.760 -> 00:45:06.400] different perspectives one framework
- [00:45:04.760 -> 00:45:08.240] will resonate with you and help the zle
- [00:45:06.400 -> 00:45:10.000] Caston system click now that you've seen
- [00:45:08.240 -> 00:45:12.119] the Frameworks let's go back to the
- [00:45:10.000 -> 00:45:14.000] molecular zle Caston system in a
- [00:45:12.119 -> 00:45:16.359] simplified format so you can see here
- [00:45:14.000 -> 00:45:19.079] I've separated this into an external box
- [00:45:16.359 -> 00:45:20.800] and an internal box the external box is
- [00:45:19.079 -> 00:45:23.720] the reference manager and this is where
- [00:45:20.800 -> 00:45:25.960] we take sources and we have these
- [00:45:23.720 -> 00:45:27.599] sources are experiences that we've had
- [00:45:25.960 -> 00:45:29.480] like reading a book watching a movie
- [00:45:27.599 -> 00:45:31.839] listening to a podcast and we can
- [00:45:29.480 -> 00:45:34.079] reference specific quotes from that
- [00:45:31.839 -> 00:45:35.839] source with a particular citation and I
- [00:45:34.079 -> 00:45:38.000] use a specific citation manager called
- [00:45:35.839 -> 00:45:40.319] zoto but I'll get into that in another
- [00:45:38.000 -> 00:45:42.200] video then we go through and we distill
- [00:45:40.319 -> 00:45:44.240] the information from those sources into
- [00:45:42.200 -> 00:45:46.000] atoms into permanent notes then on the
- [00:45:44.240 -> 00:45:47.599] internal side as we have ideas we can
- [00:45:46.000 -> 00:45:49.839] add those to fleeting notes as we have
- [00:45:47.599 -> 00:45:52.160] thoughts we can begin to accumulate
- [00:45:49.839 -> 00:45:54.760] potential connections between atoms as
- [00:45:52.160 -> 00:45:56.640] we go through and reread the atoms in
- [00:45:54.760 -> 00:45:59.119] our specific folder that contains all of
- [00:45:56.640 -> 00:46:00.920] the at the external slip box we can
- [00:45:59.119 -> 00:46:02.760] piece them together with new ideas and
- [00:46:00.920 -> 00:46:04.960] insights to produce permanent notes in
- [00:46:02.760 -> 00:46:06.400] our own words this would be a molecule
- [00:46:04.960 -> 00:46:08.119] now let's apply personal Knowledge
- [00:46:06.400 -> 00:46:10.640] Management that hourglass shape that we
- [00:46:08.119 -> 00:46:12.960] saw above to the zle cting system so
- [00:46:10.640 -> 00:46:16.440] that we have a flow here this is my
- [00:46:12.960 -> 00:46:19.040] molecular workflow I go and I seek new
- [00:46:16.440 -> 00:46:20.760] experiences new information this comes
- [00:46:19.040 -> 00:46:23.160] to me in the form of data it could be
- [00:46:20.760 -> 00:46:25.920] the source name the author the topic and
- [00:46:23.160 -> 00:46:28.440] it's some external source that I am
- [00:46:25.920 -> 00:46:29.960] capturing as I I consume that data I
- [00:46:28.440 -> 00:46:31.920] capture what resonates I write down
- [00:46:29.960 -> 00:46:33.760] quotes and I write down Concepts and
- [00:46:31.920 -> 00:46:35.280] ideas that are derived from that
- [00:46:33.760 -> 00:46:37.400] particular Source I seek that
- [00:46:35.280 -> 00:46:39.440] information and I capture what resonates
- [00:46:37.400 -> 00:46:41.240] in the form of information now this is a
- [00:46:39.440 -> 00:46:43.319] contextual experience because that
- [00:46:41.240 -> 00:46:45.200] information those quotes are still tied
- [00:46:43.319 -> 00:46:47.680] to the specific Source themselves this
- [00:46:45.200 -> 00:46:51.680] is all an external system then what I do
- [00:46:47.680 -> 00:46:53.720] is I decontextualize I extract the atoms
- [00:46:51.680 -> 00:46:56.640] from their context and apply it to my
- [00:46:53.720 -> 00:46:58.520] own life this is an internal application
- [00:46:56.640 -> 00:47:00.119] that makes connections between atoms in
- [00:46:58.520 -> 00:47:02.720] a way that it removes it from the
- [00:47:00.119 -> 00:47:05.240] context it decontextualizes this is
- [00:47:02.720 -> 00:47:06.720] where I apply that information to my own
- [00:47:05.240 -> 00:47:08.760] life and make connections based on
- [00:47:06.720 -> 00:47:10.280] relevance and thoughts and ideas based
- [00:47:08.760 -> 00:47:12.319] on the projects and questions that I
- [00:47:10.280 -> 00:47:14.440] have then I go back through and I try to
- [00:47:12.319 -> 00:47:16.200] make sense of those notes I try to go
- [00:47:14.440 -> 00:47:18.960] through my molecules through my
- [00:47:16.200 -> 00:47:20.280] knowledge box and identify new insights
- [00:47:18.960 -> 00:47:22.960] so this could be where I'm reading
- [00:47:20.280 -> 00:47:24.839] through a note on digital gardening and
- [00:47:22.960 -> 00:47:26.920] I have an idea on how digital gardening
- [00:47:24.839 -> 00:47:29.800] can apply to the zle casting system so I
- [00:47:26.920 -> 00:47:31.599] have a new insight I feel called by some
- [00:47:29.800 -> 00:47:33.559] form of intuition because I've gone back
- [00:47:31.599 -> 00:47:35.319] through and read my own words that
- [00:47:33.559 -> 00:47:37.280] relate to a problem that I'm having
- [00:47:35.319 -> 00:47:39.720] towards a goal or a purpose that I have
- [00:47:37.280 -> 00:47:41.559] in a project I can take that insight and
- [00:47:39.720 -> 00:47:44.079] I can apply it to the knowledge and I
- [00:47:41.559 -> 00:47:45.359] can write a path for future me to follow
- [00:47:44.079 -> 00:47:47.240] I'm producing what's called a wisdom
- [00:47:45.359 -> 00:47:49.400] Bridge so that when I come back to that
- [00:47:47.240 -> 00:47:51.119] Concept in the future I know exactly how
- [00:47:49.400 -> 00:47:53.400] to walk that path again because I've
- [00:47:51.119 -> 00:47:55.520] already distilled the essence down to
- [00:47:53.400 -> 00:47:57.400] its purest form in a way that's going to
- [00:47:55.520 -> 00:47:59.079] be the most applicable to me then I can
- [00:47:57.400 -> 00:48:01.680] take those insights and knowledge that
- [00:47:59.079 -> 00:48:03.960] wisdom and I can recontextualize it I
- [00:48:01.680 -> 00:48:05.520] can add back the information the
- [00:48:03.960 -> 00:48:07.400] reference to the particular source is
- [00:48:05.520 -> 00:48:09.359] where I got it from because I'm keeping
- [00:48:07.400 -> 00:48:11.440] track of my citations here and I can
- [00:48:09.359 -> 00:48:13.559] share that wisdom and knowledge as
- [00:48:11.440 -> 00:48:15.520] information to other people so it forms
- [00:48:13.559 -> 00:48:17.280] an external source of information and
- [00:48:15.520 -> 00:48:18.480] data for someone else this is where I
- [00:48:17.280 -> 00:48:20.319] have three different methods of doing
- [00:48:18.480 -> 00:48:22.800] this I have cultivating publishing and
- [00:48:20.319 -> 00:48:25.480] printing cultivating is taking my notes
- [00:48:22.800 -> 00:48:27.040] and even if they're only 20% or 50%
- [00:48:25.480 -> 00:48:28.720] ready to be published I publish them
- [00:48:27.040 -> 00:48:30.319] anyway into my digital Garden I have a
- [00:48:28.720 -> 00:48:32.040] whole video on digital gardening and how
- [00:48:30.319 -> 00:48:33.880] you can convert your obsidian Vault into
- [00:48:32.040 -> 00:48:35.319] a digital Garden for free as a
- [00:48:33.880 -> 00:48:37.000] publication system so if you're
- [00:48:35.319 -> 00:48:38.839] interested I recommend checking that out
- [00:48:37.000 -> 00:48:40.960] or I can publish it in a more refined
- [00:48:38.839 -> 00:48:43.040] format I can take it and I can add it as
- [00:48:40.960 -> 00:48:44.599] a newsletter or as this YouTube video
- [00:48:43.040 -> 00:48:46.440] that would be a published format and
- [00:48:44.599 -> 00:48:48.040] finally if I wanted to I could get into
- [00:48:46.440 -> 00:48:50.000] academic writing where I'm actually
- [00:48:48.040 -> 00:48:52.040] printing something where I need to have
- [00:48:50.000 -> 00:48:54.559] all of the citations organized because I
- [00:48:52.040 -> 00:48:56.920] need to have the output be highly
- [00:48:54.559 -> 00:48:59.480] credible for it to be accepted as either
- [00:48:56.920 -> 00:49:01.480] an academic paper or book as I publish
- [00:48:59.480 -> 00:49:03.559] this information I can generate data on
- [00:49:01.480 -> 00:49:05.799] what other people find impactful and I
- [00:49:03.559 -> 00:49:08.040] can use that as a form of information
- [00:49:05.799 -> 00:49:09.960] that helps me decide what to produce
- [00:49:08.040 -> 00:49:12.720] next time so we get this really nice
- [00:49:09.960 -> 00:49:14.559] feedback loop of the flow of knowledge
- [00:49:12.720 -> 00:49:15.920] okay so now that we've gone through more
- [00:49:14.559 -> 00:49:17.960] of the Frameworks and you've seen how
- [00:49:15.920 -> 00:49:19.720] the flow of knowledge Works in my zle
- [00:49:17.960 -> 00:49:21.640] casting system I thought I would apply a
- [00:49:19.720 -> 00:49:23.319] couple laws here just to I just want you
- [00:49:21.640 -> 00:49:25.440] to keep this in mind as we go through
- [00:49:23.319 -> 00:49:27.680] and create the templates for each of the
- [00:49:25.440 -> 00:49:29.240] different notes because it's really easy
- [00:49:27.680 -> 00:49:31.160] to get overwhelmed with all of this so
- [00:49:29.240 -> 00:49:33.720] sometimes it's it's helpful to have a
- [00:49:31.160 -> 00:49:35.359] few rules a few laws that you like to
- [00:49:33.720 -> 00:49:36.920] apply that you can default back to if
- [00:49:35.359 -> 00:49:39.200] you're starting to feel overwhelmed the
- [00:49:36.920 -> 00:49:41.319] first law is that we value connecting
- [00:49:39.200 -> 00:49:42.960] over collecting when you connect notes
- [00:49:41.319 -> 00:49:45.240] together you begin to have nonlinear
- [00:49:42.960 -> 00:49:47.520] growth you can have emergent properties
- [00:49:45.240 -> 00:49:49.079] and patterns come into existence by
- [00:49:47.520 -> 00:49:51.000] virtue of connecting your knowledge
- [00:49:49.079 -> 00:49:53.240] together by connecting an atom to an
- [00:49:51.000 -> 00:49:55.040] idea to form a molecule or multiple
- [00:49:53.240 -> 00:49:56.400] atoms together to form a molecule this
- [00:49:55.040 -> 00:49:57.920] is in contrast to just writing down a
- [00:49:56.400 -> 00:49:59.559] quote which is how most people take
- [00:49:57.920 -> 00:50:01.480] notes this is traditional note taking
- [00:49:59.559 -> 00:50:03.480] where you just write down quotes and it
- [00:50:01.480 -> 00:50:05.359] can be really difficult to derive a lot
- [00:50:03.480 -> 00:50:07.960] of value from that because it's been
- [00:50:05.359 -> 00:50:10.200] removed from its context and you tend to
- [00:50:07.960 -> 00:50:12.119] just read it in a linear format by
- [00:50:10.200 -> 00:50:15.040] making connections between notes we're
- [00:50:12.119 -> 00:50:16.880] introducing a nonlinear pattern here and
- [00:50:15.040 -> 00:50:19.599] that has a lot more potential to have
- [00:50:16.880 -> 00:50:21.839] exponential value another law is that
- [00:50:19.599 -> 00:50:23.119] projects guide your insights so projects
- [00:50:21.839 -> 00:50:25.079] could be questions that you're trying to
- [00:50:23.119 -> 00:50:26.359] solve problems you're trying to solve
- [00:50:25.079 -> 00:50:28.880] just things that you're trying to get
- [00:50:26.359 -> 00:50:30.680] more information on Research into so
- [00:50:28.880 -> 00:50:32.400] that you can have a direct application
- [00:50:30.680 -> 00:50:33.720] to your own life if you're just writing
- [00:50:32.400 -> 00:50:35.760] down notes if you're just collecting
- [00:50:33.720 -> 00:50:37.520] quotes but you're not actually trying to
- [00:50:35.760 -> 00:50:39.440] keep track of your insights on how those
- [00:50:37.520 -> 00:50:41.960] quotes can apply to your life then this
- [00:50:39.440 -> 00:50:43.440] whole system is far less effective it's
- [00:50:41.960 -> 00:50:45.359] really hard to put into words how
- [00:50:43.440 -> 00:50:47.240] effective it can become if you use
- [00:50:45.359 -> 00:50:49.119] projects to guide your insights another
- [00:50:47.240 -> 00:50:50.680] law is that less is more we don't want
- [00:50:49.119 -> 00:50:51.960] to have a ton of information here we
- [00:50:50.680 -> 00:50:54.000] have enough information with the
- [00:50:51.960 -> 00:50:56.079] internet the goal is to try and reduce
- [00:50:54.000 -> 00:50:57.920] and distill the information to its core
- [00:50:56.079 -> 00:50:59.440] so that it can be far more applicable
- [00:50:57.920 -> 00:51:02.040] and related to the connecting over
- [00:50:59.440 -> 00:51:04.119] collecting we have create over copy you
- [00:51:02.040 -> 00:51:05.400] want to write your own words when you're
- [00:51:04.119 -> 00:51:07.400] writing down notes you don't want to
- [00:51:05.400 -> 00:51:09.559] just copy something verbatim this is
- [00:51:07.400 -> 00:51:11.760] called the generation effect where by
- [00:51:09.559 -> 00:51:13.760] writing in your own words by converting
- [00:51:11.760 -> 00:51:15.880] a quote into something that actually has
- [00:51:13.760 -> 00:51:18.200] meaning to you you're far more likely to
- [00:51:15.880 -> 00:51:20.440] remember that information as knowledge
- [00:51:18.200 -> 00:51:22.240] if you just copy it down it's likely to
- [00:51:20.440 -> 00:51:24.520] just flit out of your head related to
- [00:51:22.240 -> 00:51:26.559] less is more simplify you always want to
- [00:51:24.520 -> 00:51:27.799] keep distilling if the system feels too
- [00:51:26.559 -> 00:51:29.319] complicated for you to the point that
- [00:51:27.799 -> 00:51:30.960] you're not actually going to use it that
- [00:51:29.319 -> 00:51:32.960] means that it's too complex and that you
- [00:51:30.960 -> 00:51:35.000] need to simplify it the goal here is to
- [00:51:32.960 -> 00:51:36.720] make it practical for you the next law
- [00:51:35.000 -> 00:51:38.480] is that we want to build in public this
- [00:51:36.720 -> 00:51:40.200] relates to my commentary on digital
- [00:51:38.480 -> 00:51:41.440] garden and cultivating so if you're
- [00:51:40.200 -> 00:51:42.640] interested in learning more about that
- [00:51:41.440 -> 00:51:44.599] again I recommend checking out my
- [00:51:42.640 -> 00:51:46.760] digital garden video but the idea here
- [00:51:44.599 -> 00:51:49.000] is that rather than striving for
- [00:51:46.760 -> 00:51:50.839] perfectionism we can instead share
- [00:51:49.000 -> 00:51:52.359] information as knowledge for other
- [00:51:50.839 -> 00:51:54.599] people and help guide them to make their
- [00:51:52.359 -> 00:51:56.040] own connections even if it's not at a
- [00:51:54.599 -> 00:51:57.960] point that we would typically think of
- [00:51:56.040 -> 00:51:59.920] it being ready for publication there's a
- [00:51:57.960 -> 00:52:01.880] lot of value in helping people along the
- [00:51:59.920 -> 00:52:03.799] way cuz they might only be a step or two
- [00:52:01.880 -> 00:52:05.920] behind you rather than trying to spend
- [00:52:03.799 -> 00:52:07.240] months to draft an article that's in its
- [00:52:05.920 -> 00:52:09.119] perfect format and related to
- [00:52:07.240 -> 00:52:11.720] simplification we want to recalibrate
- [00:52:09.119 -> 00:52:13.880] for insights what I mean by that is as
- [00:52:11.720 -> 00:52:15.559] you go through and as you start to build
- [00:52:13.880 -> 00:52:17.520] out your molecular slip box your
- [00:52:15.559 -> 00:52:19.559] thinking box you might find that one
- [00:52:17.520 -> 00:52:21.520] type of system works better than another
- [00:52:19.559 -> 00:52:22.920] if that's the case go with it the whole
- [00:52:21.520 -> 00:52:25.440] point here is that we're trying to
- [00:52:22.920 -> 00:52:27.119] experiment for a way that works best for
- [00:52:25.440 -> 00:52:29.079] you you want to follow follow your own
- [00:52:27.119 -> 00:52:31.480] intuition and then recalibrate your
- [00:52:29.079 -> 00:52:33.319] system as you identify those key moments
- [00:52:31.480 -> 00:52:35.319] of intuition and finally we don't want
- [00:52:33.319 -> 00:52:36.480] to have any orphan notes and basically
- [00:52:35.319 -> 00:52:38.000] what that means is that if we're
- [00:52:36.480 -> 00:52:40.920] dropping something into our molecular
- [00:52:38.000 -> 00:52:43.240] slip box into our idea generator box we
- [00:52:40.920 -> 00:52:44.839] don't want to just add an orphan note a
- [00:52:43.240 -> 00:52:46.880] note that has no connection to any other
- [00:52:44.839 -> 00:52:49.440] note the only notes that should go into
- [00:52:46.880 -> 00:52:51.480] the molecule box into the idea generator
- [00:52:49.440 -> 00:52:53.440] box is a note that we've already made a
- [00:52:51.480 -> 00:52:55.400] connection to another note that way we
- [00:52:53.440 -> 00:52:57.720] can begin to generate note sequences and
- [00:52:55.400 -> 00:52:59.960] we can link those con together connect
- [00:52:57.720 -> 00:53:01.480] the dots between our thoughts over time
- [00:52:59.960 -> 00:53:03.680] and that's where we really start to get
- [00:53:01.480 -> 00:53:05.760] this nonlinear value this emergent
- [00:53:03.680 -> 00:53:08.520] property coming into existence so now
- [00:53:05.760 -> 00:53:09.880] it's time to get into templates okay I
- [00:53:08.520 -> 00:53:11.240] think that that's enough theory for the
- [00:53:09.880 -> 00:53:13.280] moment I realize that this has been a
- [00:53:11.240 -> 00:53:15.160] lot of information before we get into
- [00:53:13.280 -> 00:53:17.079] the templating and the Practical element
- [00:53:15.160 -> 00:53:19.440] of building my molecular zle cast and
- [00:53:17.079 -> 00:53:21.680] System including Source templates
- [00:53:19.440 -> 00:53:23.920] fleeing note templates literature note
- [00:53:21.680 -> 00:53:25.559] templates and permanent note templates
- [00:53:23.920 -> 00:53:27.160] along with how I use all of those
- [00:53:25.559 -> 00:53:29.960] different note types to build out my
- [00:53:27.160 -> 00:53:32.880] publishable notes my Alloys I think it's
- [00:53:29.960 -> 00:53:35.240] worth taking some time for you to go
- [00:53:32.880 -> 00:53:36.480] through and think of your own goals of
- [00:53:35.240 -> 00:53:39.200] what you're trying to do with this
- [00:53:36.480 -> 00:53:40.799] system the better an idea you have of
- [00:53:39.200 -> 00:53:42.599] these goals the easier and more
- [00:53:40.799 -> 00:53:44.480] practical this type of system will be
- [00:53:42.599 -> 00:53:46.480] and the more helpful my templated system
- [00:53:44.480 -> 00:53:49.359] will be because you'll understand how to
- [00:53:46.480 -> 00:53:50.920] modify it to meet your own needs so stay
- [00:53:49.359 -> 00:53:52.880] tuned for part two of this video where I
- [00:53:50.920 -> 00:53:55.119] get into the templating and the actual
- [00:53:52.880 -> 00:53:57.160] practical implementation of a zle Casten
- [00:53:55.119 -> 00:53:59.400] system in obsidian which I'm calling
- [00:53:57.160 -> 00:54:00.680] molecular zcas if you found this video
- [00:53:59.400 -> 00:54:02.640] valuable I would love if you would
- [00:54:00.680 -> 00:54:04.240] please consider subscribing the more
- [00:54:02.640 -> 00:54:06.119] people that subscribe the more I build
- [00:54:04.240 -> 00:54:07.799] up my YouTube the more time I can spend
- [00:54:06.119 -> 00:54:10.079] making videos like this so I really
- [00:54:07.799 -> 00:54:11.799] appreciate any support you might also
- [00:54:10.079 -> 00:54:13.319] find it valuable to share with a friend
- [00:54:11.799 -> 00:54:14.720] I found that talking about this system
- [00:54:13.319 -> 00:54:16.839] with a few other people has been the
- [00:54:14.720 -> 00:54:18.720] most beneficial for me as it starts to
- [00:54:16.839 -> 00:54:20.760] make it seem a lot more tangible and
- [00:54:18.720 -> 00:54:22.680] real word of mouth is by far the best
- [00:54:20.760 -> 00:54:24.079] way to help me grow so again I really
- [00:54:22.680 -> 00:54:25.520] appreciate your support if you're
- [00:54:24.079 -> 00:54:27.040] confused at all with the system please
- [00:54:25.520 -> 00:54:28.880] feel free to leave a comment M below and
- [00:54:27.040 -> 00:54:30.559] I'll go through and answer them I think
- [00:54:28.880 -> 00:54:32.760] the more we talk about this the easier
- [00:54:30.559 -> 00:54:34.599] it starts to help many other people
- [00:54:32.760 -> 00:54:36.119] understand personal Knowledge Management
- [00:54:34.599 -> 00:54:38.040] and hopefully reduce information
- [00:54:36.119 -> 00:54:39.960] overload which can then boost the mental
- [00:54:38.040 -> 00:54:41.720] health of everyone in society if you're
- [00:54:39.960 -> 00:54:43.119] interested I will be taking my template
- [00:54:41.720 -> 00:54:45.160] system that I talk about in the next
- [00:54:43.119 -> 00:54:47.280] video and I'll be packaging it as a zip
- [00:54:45.160 -> 00:54:49.319] file as a vault starter kit for
- [00:54:47.280 -> 00:54:51.119] molecular zle Casten and I'll be making
- [00:54:49.319 -> 00:54:53.400] that available on the cheapest tier of
- [00:54:51.119 -> 00:54:56.400] my YouTube membership which is $299
- [00:54:53.400 -> 00:54:57.880] Canadian or $2 us so if you found this
- [00:54:56.400 -> 00:54:59.599] valuable and would like to support me so
- [00:54:57.880 -> 00:55:01.240] that I can continue to make more videos
- [00:54:59.599 -> 00:55:02.599] please consider joining my membership
- [00:55:01.240 -> 00:55:04.440] finally if you're interested in learning
- [00:55:02.599 -> 00:55:06.559] more about what obsidian is and how it
- [00:55:04.440 -> 00:55:08.400] can be structured in different ways and
- [00:55:06.559 -> 00:55:10.359] how you can use obsidian to form part of
- [00:55:08.400 -> 00:55:12.760] a digital Garden to help you share your
- [00:55:10.359 -> 00:55:14.599] knowledge and to cultivate it over time
- [00:55:12.760 -> 00:55:16.880] along with artificial intelligence that
- [00:55:14.599 -> 00:55:18.440] can boost this entire system I have a
- [00:55:16.880 -> 00:55:20.160] playlist here that goes in depth on
- [00:55:18.440 -> 00:55:22.240] obsidian digital gardening personal
- [00:55:20.160 -> 00:55:24.880] Knowledge Management and augmenting it
- [00:55:22.240 -> 00:55:28.319] all with AI thanks again for watching
- [00:55:24.880 -> 00:55:28.319] and I will see you in the next video
